# TROUBLESHOOTING

A troubleshooting guide is provided to suggest probable causes and remedies for the most likely problems encountered. If the problem remains after exhausting the troubleshooting steps, contact the Bunn-O-Matic Technical Service Department.

- Inspection, testing, and repair of electrical equipment should be performed only by qualified service personnel.
- All electronic components have AC line voltage and some have low voltage DC potential on their terminals. Shorting of terminals or the application of external voltages may result in board failure.
- Intermittent operation of electronic circuit boards is unlikely. Board failure will normally be permanent. If an intermittent condition is encountered, the cause will likely be a switch contact or a loose connection at a terminal or crimp.
- Solenoid removal requires interrupting the water supply to the valve. Damage may result if solenoids are energized for more than ten minutes without a supply of water.
- The use of two wrenches is recommended whenever plumbing fittings are tightened or loosened. This will help to avoid twists and kinks in the tubing.
- Make certain that all plumbing connections are sealed and electrical connections tight and isolated.
- This brewer is heated at all times. Keep away from combustibles.

## WARNING

- **Exercise extreme caution when servicing electrical equipment.**  
- **Unplug the brewer when servicing, except when electrical tests are specified.**  
- **Follow recommended service procedures.**  
- **Replace all protective shields or safety notices.**  

Before troubleshooting this brewer, check for the following:

### Control Boards

1. Make sure ribbon cable is properly attached to the control board (**ALL PINS INSERTED INTO PLUG**).
2. Make sure there is a nylon insulating washer under each screw head that holds the control board to the plastic front end cap. This is important for proper operation.
3. Make sure before servicing brewer that voltage is present at control board.
4. Press any warmer switch or observe if any indicator lights are glowing on the control panel. If so, proceed with testing. If not, check for voltage across pins 1 & 2 of the ten-pin J1 connector (black and white wires).  
   - If voltage is present, replace the control board.  
   - If voltage is not present, check wiring and voltage across terminal block (black and white). Correct the problem and retest before proceeding with testing.

**NOTE:** *In the event of board replacement, technician will need to re-program customer's settings and/or recipes, as well as re-calibrate the temperature probe in program level 3 and re-enter the serial number in level 4.*

# MEMBRANE SWITCH

## Location:
The Membrane Switch is located on the front face plate.

## Test Procedures:
There are two methods for testing the membrane switch. The easiest method is to use the built-in test mode. Refer to the Programming Section for Service Tools/Test Switches. If for some reason you can't get into the program modes, or the brewer won't power up, you can test it with an ohmmeter or continuity tester. Refer to the schematic to trace the appropriate pins.

**NOTE:** Pin 22 is the static shield & will not provide a reading to the other pins. There are two commons in this circuit, pins 9 & 10. **Disconnect brewer from power source before disconnecting ribbon cable from control board.**

## Removal and Replacement:
1. Disconnect the ribbon cable from the 22-pin connector on the control board.
2. Gently peel the membrane switch from the front face plate assembly.
3. Remove any adhesive that remains on the front face plate.
4. Remove the adhesive backing from the new membrane switch. Insert the ribbon cable through the slot in the front face plate and apply the membrane switch to the front face plate.
5. Connect the ribbon cable to the 22-pin connector on the control board, making sure every pin on the control board is inserted into the ribbon cable connector.

   **If voltage is not present, refer to Wiring Diagrams and check main wiring harness.**  
   **If harness checks OK, replace control board.**

4. Check the refill valve for coil action. *Briefly* activate the refill valve in the test mode and listen carefully near the refill valve for a "clicking" sound as the magnetic coil pulls the plunger in.

   - **If the sound is heard as described and water will not pass through the refill valve**, there may be a blockage in the water line before the refill valve, or the solenoid valve may require inspection for wear and removal of waterborne particles.
   - **If the sound is not heard as described, proceed to #5.**

5. Disconnect the brewer from the power source.
6. Check for resistance across the coil terminals (**200Ω - 2kΩ** depending on which coil is being checked).

   - **If resistance is not present as described, replace the refill valve.**  
   - **If resistance is present as described, check for debris in the valve.**

## Removal and Replacement:
1. Remove both wires from the refill valve.
2. Verify that the white shutoff clamp between the valve and tank is squeezed shut.
3. Disconnect both water lines at the valve.
4. Remove the two screws securing the valve to the component mounting bracket.
