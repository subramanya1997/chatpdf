## Installation

> ⚠️ **WARNING**  
> Before operating or maintaining the dock leveler, read and follow the safety practices contained in this manual. Failure to follow the guidelines in this manual and those in effect in the workplace can result in serious bodily harm and equipment damage.

### Pit Check

1. Check the entire pit area for proper construction according to the certified pit drawings. Ensure the pit walls are square and plumb. If this is a replacement unit, ensure the steel sections are in good, weldable condition. Check the electrical service and make sure it is the same as the voltage and phase as shown on the wiring diagram in the control panel.

2. Complete any pre-wiring procedures that are required **before** the dock is placed in the pit. This includes all conduits, wiring boxes, receptacles, etc. that are required.

3. One standard 115 VAC receptacle (NEMA 5-15R – supplied by others) is required in the pit to plug in the fan motor. The correct pit wall location for this receptacle is given in the drawing on the next page.

4. Make sure that any conduits and/or junction boxes do not interfere with the rear frame uprights. See the diagram on the following page for proper placement.

### Dock Installation

**Note:** When moving the dock leveler in preparation for installation, it is crucial that the unit be moved only using the fork pockets at the rear of the frame.

# Nordock Inc. Parts and Service Manual 49-0245-E: AD 25-50K Dock Levelers

1. The dock leveler has been shipped with the dock bumpers and push-button control station attached to the rear of the frame. These items must be removed before the leveler is placed in the pit.

2. Have the pushbutton station mounted and wired by a qualified electrician. See the electrical diagram inside the control panel or at the end of this manual. Wires shown as dashed lines are field connections.

3. **The rear shims must be measured and welded to the bottom of the rear frame before the dock leveler is placed into the pit.** In order to build up the correct height of shims at each support point, lay a taught string line across the side curb steel approximately 5” in from the rear angle. Stack shims until they are 19” (+1/16” –0”) or 23” (+1/16” –0”) below the string line. Make sure shim heights are all the same depth from the edge of the pit area. See **Figure 1** for correct placement of shims.

4. Once the correct shim height is achieved for each position, remove the shims from the pit and weld them to their corresponding placement on the leveler frame. For best weld, stagger shims at least 1/4”.

# Nordock Inc. Parts and Service Manual 49-0245-E: AD 25-50K Dock Levelers

Shims must be placed in the following six areas (**refer to Figure 2**):

### I. 
- Under both frame rails directly behind the lip keeper lugs.  
  *(2 places all 6’, 6.5’ and 7’ 25-50K frames)*

### II. 
- Under frame angle at the uprights connecting to the hinge angle.  
  *(4 places all 6’, 6.5’ and 7’ 25-50K frames)*

![Figure 2](image-placeholder)

---

### 5. 
Remove any straps holding the motor cord and plug and if required. Temporarily strap it to a rear frame upright so that it can be easily reached for connection to the pit receptacle.

### 6. 
Attach lifting chains to the front of dock leveler and a swivel hoisting ring to the rear of the dock leveler in the **3/4”-10 threaded hole**.

All chains must be **minimum grade 80** and chain hooks must have a **minimum 1-ton capacity**. An **endless master link** should also be used to assist in the leveling of the dock leveler. 

Three chains must be used:
- One hooked at the center of the hinge angle.
- Two hooked on the front deck plate outside the second set of lip lugs from the sides of the deck.

Attach the chains so that the master link is approximately **12” forward of the center of the deck**, and centered along the width.  

**See Figure 3 on the following page.**

**IF AN AIR LEAK IS SUSPECTED, A FORK TRUCK OR OTHER SIMILAR AUXILIARY MEANS MUST BE USED TO RAISE THE DOCK IN ORDER TO INSTALL THE MAINTENANCE STAND.**

---

### **Blower does not operate when button is pressed**

1. Check that the main power source is turned on.
2. Check that all installation connections are made.
3. Ensure motor voltage matches the incoming service.
4. Ensure pushbutton is functioning.

## Blower operates but Dock Leveler does not raise

1. Check motor rotation.
2. Make sure dock leveler is not loaded.
3. Check airbag and pump connection, ensuring there are no leaks.
4. Check for any damaged or broken components.

## Dock leveler fails to lower

> ⚠ **WARNING**  
> DO NOT ENTER THE AREA UNDER THE DOCK LEVELER IF IT FAILS TO LOWER

1. Check that there are no obstructions beneath the dock.
2. Check that the lip extension mechanism is not jammed in the extended position.
3. Check that there are no bent or broken components.

**Note:** **DO NOT FORCE THE DOCK LEVELER DOWN BY ANY MEANS FOR ANY REASON.**

> ⚠ **WARNING**  
> DO NOT ENTER THE AREA UNDER THE DOCK LEVELER OR LIP IF THE LIP FAILS TO EXTEND OR FAILS TO UNLOCK.

## Lip fails to extend, lock or retract

1. For the lip to extend, the deck must be raised until it hits the stop on the frame **before** the “RAISE” button is released.  
   If the deck does not reach full elevation, the lip mechanism will not engage and the lip will not extend.  
   - i. Check that there is not an air leak around the blower fittings, or a hole in the airbag.  
   - ii. Check that there is not an obstruction to the blower air inlet filter.  
   - iii. Check that there is not something mechanical obstructing the deck or airpan movement.  

2. Once the deck has reached its full elevation, the lip mechanism will engage and the “RAISE” button should be released.  
   If the lip does not extend as the deck lowers:  
   - i. Check that the roller in the front lip pushbar turns freely on the axle and that the axle turns freely in the brackets.  
   - ii. Check that the rear pushbar fork notches are square, sharp, and parallel with each other.  
   - iii. With the deck fully raised, check that there is enough tension on the rear pushbar by the spring to hold the roller against the roller block when the deck begins to lower. *(Note: The spring becomes slack after the lip begins to extend.)*  

3. As the dock lowers, the lip will extend and lock in position.  
   If the lip falls back in and/or fails to lock:  
   - i. Check items **i** & **ii** from step **2**.

# Nordock Inc. Parts and Service Manual 49-0245-E: AD 25-50K Dock Levelers

## Lip Mechanism Check

ii. Check that the front of the roller block is square to the deck and free of burrs and debris.  
iii. Check that the kick-out lever block rests flat against the deck.  

4. When the roller has slipped in front of the roller block, the lip is locked in the extended position.  
   The lip mechanism will release once a truck bed has supported the lip or once the deck has fully lowered and the frame has activated the kick-out lever. If the lip fails to release:  

   i. Check that the front pushbar pivots freely in the brackets on the lip.  
   ii. Check that the kick-out bar engages with the landing pad on the frame.  

## Unexpected Noise

A certain amount of blower noise, mechanical creaking, and airbag stretching is to be expected of this machine. Proper lubrication and maintenance inspection will ensure many years of efficient operation. If airbag noise (popping sound caused by the vinyl against the pan surfaces) is louder than expected, check the bag for dirt and moisture and clean as necessary.

## Lip Gas Spring Installation Procedure

> ⚠ **WARNING**  
> Before operating or maintaining the dock leveler, read and follow the safety practices contained in this manual. Failure to follow the guidelines in this manual and those in effect in the workplace can result in serious bodily harm and equipment damage.

1. Install barricades in the building in front of the dock area and in the driveway to prevent vehicular access.  
2. Raise the deck and install the deck maintenance strut as per the Maintenance Procedure in the Safety section of this manual. (An additional, secondary support may also be used in compliance with the particular service company’s standard procedures or end user’s safety committee guidelines.)  
3. Lock/tag out power to the leveler.  
4. Manually lift the lip. Pull the lip lock out from the headboard and slide it across the front of the headboard to hold the lip in the extended position.  
5. Push up on the lip to open it fully and install a shim plate between the top of the lip lock and the underside of the lip. This will hold the lip in the fully open position so that the holes in the gas spring clevis and lip bracket line up.  
6. Proceed to replace the gas spring.  
7. Push up on the lip and remove the shim plate from the top of the lip lock.  
8. Remove all tools/equipment from the pit area and be sure all personnel are clear of the deck and lip assemblies.  
9. Push up on the lip and return the lip lock to the storage position and allow the lip to fall pendant.  
10. Remove lock/tag-outs and apply power to the leveler.  
11. Raise the leveler up and store the maintenance strut in storage keepers on the frame.  
12. Ensure all equipment and personnel are clear of the leveler, allow the deck to lower and return to the stored position.  
13. Test full dock leveler operation and store the leveler when complete.  
14. Remove barricades from around the leveler.
