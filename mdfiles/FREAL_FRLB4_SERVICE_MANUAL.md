## Front Door Gasket Inspection and Installation

### 1. Inspecting the Gasket:
- If you inspect the back of the Gasket, it should not be folded over and permanently creased. If it is, replace **Chamber Door Assembly** (Parts Manual: Behind the Front Door).
- If the fin around the outer circumference of the gasket is fine, proceed to Step 2.B.

### 2. Installing the Front Door Gasket:
- **Ensure the Gasket and the channel on the Front Door wedge are clean and dry.**
  - You can also wipe dry any residual water that may be resting on the outside of the opening on the chamber.
- **Locate the fin on the outer circumference of the back of the gasket.** Ensure that when you install the Gasket back into the Front Door Wedge channel that it doesn't fold over at any time.
  - Install the fin first at a 45-degree angle and press the raised portion on the front of the Gasket until it's seated into place inside the Front Door Wedge channel.
- **Once the gasket is fully inserted into the Front Door Wedge channel, ensure that the gasket is slightly pulled out of the channel.** Roughly **1/8" or 1/4"**, at most.
  - If the Gasket seems to not be fully seated in the channel after this adjustment, don't readjust. Closing the front door will push the gasket in to the correct depth.
- **Close the door and run another cycle to see if the drips return.** If it leaks, wipe it dry and attempt another cycle. If it still leaks, proceed to Step 3.

### 3. Ensure the drain does not have an Air-Lock issue:
- **Follow the drain all the way back to the floor drain.**
  - Ensure the drain flows in a downward direction at **ALL** times (no loops, kinks, etc.).
  - Ensure the end of the blender's drain is **NOT** submerged in water.
- **Close the door and run another cycle to see if the drips return.** If it leaks, wipe it dry and attempt another cycle. If it still leaks, proceed to Step 4.

### 4. Inspect the (4) corners of the Front Door Wedge to see if it's "shimmed" out:
- **If there are (4) washers already behind the Front Door Wedge,** remove the top (2) washers with a **9/64" Hex Head tool**. Leave the (2) on the bottom that are already shimming the Front Door Wedge out.
- **If there are no washers between the back of the LCD Screen and the Front Door Wedge,** follow the process below to shim the wedge out:
  - Add another washer between the back of the LCD screen and Front Door Wedge on the bottom (2) corners. This will add more pressure on the bottom of the Front Door Wedge and chamber opening when the door is closed.
- **Close the door and run another cycle to see if the drips return.** If it leaks, wipe it dry and attempt another cycle. If it still leaks, proceed to Step 5.

### 5. Realign the Front Door Wedge:
- **Remove the left and right side blender panels.** Also, remove the fascia plate surrounding the chamber.
- **Locate the (4) 9/64" screws on the corners of the Front Door Wedge.** Loosen but do not remove all of the screws.
- **Close the door and ensure it has a tight seal.**
- **Looking inside the blender from the right and left sides,** you can access the top (2) 9/64" screws on the Wedge. Tighten them. Open the door and ensure all (4) screws are tightened down, securely.
- **Close the door and run another cycle to see if the drips return.** If it leaks, wipe it dry and attempt another cycle. If it still leaks, repeat the Troubleshooting process or call the **f’real Customer Support Center** for more assistance.

## Mixer System Issues

### **TRIGGER: Blender makes a grinding noise while mixing a f’real product**

1. **Ensure the Blending Components are assembled/functioning correctly and are tight.**
2. **Ensure the display freezer is between 0-6°F.**
   - **Perform the Squeeze Test.** Using a chocolate milkshake, squeeze the middle of the cup. You should be able to squeeze a dime-size dent in the milkshake.
   - Ensure the product is tempered (see the “Too Thick/Too Thin Shakes” section).
3. **Spin Mix Motor Spindle by hand to ensure it spins freely.** If the spindle won’t turn, is difficult to turn, or is bent, replace **Mix Motor** (Parts Manual: Mixer System).
4. **Check the blending chamber for damage.** If damaged, replace **Chamber Assembly** (Parts Manual: Inside the Chamber).
5. **Bring up the LVCBS Status Screen** (Press the “Left Arrow” & “OK” buttons for 7 seconds until the Status Screen appears on the screen) and locate **Line J: “Count XXXXmL”**
   - **Open the front door.**
   - **Remove the Water Shot Hose** from the back of the blending chamber.
   - **Close the front door.**
   - **Using a cup, immediately catch the water** coming through the disconnected hose. Compare the amount of water in the cup to **Line J, Count XXXX mL**.
     - If the amount in the cup is not the same as “Count” on Line J, replace **Flow Meter** (Parts Manual: Water System).

# Shakes are too thin or too thick

**TRIGGER:** Anytime a blended product has an overly runny or overly thick consistency

## Product Temperature:
1. Ensure the display freezer is between 0-6°F.
   - **A.** Perform the Squeeze Test. Using a chocolate milkshake, squeeze the middle of the cup. You should be able to squeeze a dime-size dent in the milkshake.
   - **B.** Ensure the product is tempered (see below).

## Tempering Process:
1. First, check the freezer temperature of your back-stock freezer:
   - **A.** If the back-stock freezer is 0°F, see the “Blender Issue” section below.
   - **B.** If the back-stock freezer is below 0°F, proceed to the next step.
     - **a.** When moving product from the back-stock freezer that is less than 0°F, ensure you place the product in the refrigerated section with your soda or beer for 45 minutes at the most.
     - **b.** Every 15 minutes, perform the Squeeze Test:
       - **i.** Using a chocolate milkshake, squeeze the middle of the cup. You should be able to squeeze a dime-size dent in the milkshake.
       - **ii.** If you can put a dent in the side of the shake during the squeeze test, the product is ready to move into the front display freezer.

## Blender Issue:
1. Bring up the LVCBS Status Screen (Press the “Left Arrow” & “OK” buttons for 7 seconds until the Status Screen appears on the screen) and locate **Line J: “Count XXXXmL”**.
2. Run an Empty Cup Cycle (ECC) to ensure 50-55mL of water is being dispensed into the cup.
   - **A.** To perform an ECC, locate an empty f’real cup and place it in the Cup Holder. Press and hold the “Regular” button for 25 seconds. Ensure you only monitor and note the number that it counts on **Line J: “Count XXXXmL”** during the ECC, not after. The count should be between **53-57mL** before it resets.
     - **a.** If it is between **53-57mL**, return to the "Product Temperature" section above.
     - **b.** If it is less than **53mL** or more than **57mL**:
       - **i.** If the amount of water in the cup matches the “Count” on **Line J**, replace **Manifold** (Parts Manual: Water System).
       - **ii.** If the amount of water in the cup does **NOT** match the “Count” on **Line J**, replace **Flow Meter** (Parts Manual: Water System).
