## Important

Read, understand and obey the safety rules and operating instructions in the appropriate Operator's Manual on your machine before attempting any maintenance procedure.

Basic mechanical, hydraulic and electrical skills are required to perform most procedures. However, several procedures require specialized skills, tools, lifting equipment and a suitable workshop. In these instances, we strongly recommend that maintenance and repair be performed at an authorized Genie dealer service center.

# SAFETY RULES

## Personal Safety

Any person working on or around a machine must be aware of all known safety hazards. Personal safety and the continued safe operation of the machine should be your top priority.

Read each procedure thoroughly. This manual and the decals on the machine use signal words to identify the following:

- **Safety alert symbol**—used to alert personnel to potential personal injury hazards. Obey all safety messages that follow this symbol to avoid possible injury or death.
- **Red**—used to indicate the presence of an imminently hazardous situation which, if not avoided, will result in death or serious injury.  
  **⚠ DANGER**
- **Orange**—used to indicate the presence of a potentially hazardous situation which, if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury.  
  **⚠ WARNING**
- **Yellow with safety alert symbol**—used to indicate the presence of a potentially hazardous situation which, if not avoided, may cause minor or moderate injury.  
  **⚠ CAUTION**
- **Yellow without safety alert symbol**—used to indicate the presence of a potentially hazardous situation which, if not avoided, may result in property damage.  
  **⚠ CAUTION**
- **Green**—used to indicate operation or maintenance information.  
  **ℹ NOTICE**

Be sure to:
- Wear protective eye wear and other protective clothing if the situation warrants it.
- Be aware of potential crushing hazards such as moving parts, free swinging or unsecured components when lifting or placing loads. Always wear approved steel-toed shoes.

## Workplace Safety

- Be sure to keep sparks, flames, and lighted tobacco away from flammable and combustible materials like battery gases and engine fuels. Always have an approved fire extinguisher within easy reach.
- Be sure that all tools and working areas are properly maintained and ready for use. Keep work surfaces clean and free of debris that could get into machine components and cause damage.
- Be sure that your workshop or work area is properly ventilated and well lit.
- Be sure any forklift, overhead crane, or other lifting or supporting device is fully capable of supporting and stabilizing the weight to be lifted. Use only chains or straps that are in good condition and of ample capacity.
- Be sure that fasteners intended for one-time use (i.e., cotter pins and self-locking nuts) are not reused. These components may fail if they are used a second time.
- Be sure to properly dispose of old oil or other fluids. Use an approved container. Please be environmentally safe.

# Torque Procedure

## JIC 37° Fittings

1. Align the tube flare (hex nut) against the nose of the fitting body (body hex fitting) and tighten the hex nut to the body hex fitting to hand-tight, approximately **30 in-lbs / 3.4 Nm**.

2. Make a reference mark on one of the flats of the hex nut, and continue it on to the body hex fitting with a permanent ink marker. Refer to **Figure 1**.

   **Figure 1**  
   - **a**: hydraulic hose  
   - **b**: hex nut  
   - **c**: reference mark  
   - **d**: body hex fitting  

3. Working clockwise on the body hex fitting, make a second mark with a permanent ink marker to indicate the proper tightening position. Refer to **Figure 2**.

   > **NOTICE**  
   > Use the *JIC 37° Fittings* table on the previous page to determine the correct number of flats for the proper tightening position.

   > **NOTICE**  
   > The marks indicate that the correct tightening positions have been determined. Use the second mark on the body hex fitting to properly tighten the joint after it has been loosened.

   **Figure 2**  
   - **a**: body hex fitting  
   - **b**: reference mark  
   - **c**: second mark  

4. Tighten the hex nut until the mark on the hex nut is aligned with the second mark on the body hex fitting.

5. Operate all machine functions and inspect the hoses and fittings and related components to confirm that there are no leaks.

# Pre-Delivery Preparation

## Fundamentals

It is the responsibility of the dealer to perform the Pre-delivery Preparation.

The Pre-delivery Preparation is performed prior to each delivery. The inspection is designed to discover if anything is apparently wrong with a machine before it is put into service.

A damaged or modified machine must never be used. If damage or any variation from factory delivered condition is discovered, the machine must be tagged and removed from service.

Repairs to the machine may only be made by a qualified service technician, according to the manufacturer's specifications.

Scheduled maintenance inspections shall be performed by qualified service technicians, according to the manufacturer's specifications and the requirements listed in the responsibilities manual.

## Instructions

Use the operator’s manual on your machine.

The Pre-delivery Preparation consists of completing the Pre-operation Inspection, the Maintenance items and the Function Tests.

Use this form to record the results. Place a check in the appropriate box after each part is completed. Follow the instructions in the operator’s manual.

If any inspection receives an **N**, remove the machine from service, repair and re-inspect it. After repair, place a check in the **R** box.

### Legend
- **Y** = yes, completed  
- **N** = no, unable to complete

# Section 3 • Scheduled Maintenance Procedures  
**June 2004**  

## Checklist A Procedures  
**REV B**  

### A-1 Perform Pre-operation Inspection  
Completing a Pre-operation Inspection is essential to safe machine operation. The Pre-operation Inspection is a visual inspection performed by the operator prior to each work shift. The inspection is designed to discover if anything is apparently wrong with a machine before the operator performs the function tests. The Pre-operation Inspection also serves to determine if routine maintenance procedures are required.  

Complete information to perform this procedure is available in the appropriate operator's manual.  
Refer to the Operator's Manual on your machine.  

### A-2 Perform Function Tests  
Completing the function tests is essential to safe machine operation. Function tests are designed to discover any malfunctions before the machine is put into service. A malfunctioning machine must never be used. If malfunctions are discovered, the machine must be tagged and removed from service.  

Complete information to perform this procedure is available in the appropriate operator's manual.  
Refer to the Operator's Manual on your machine.

# Checklist C Procedure

## C-1 Test the Platform Overload System (if equipped)

**NOTICE**  
Genie specifications require that this procedure be performed every 500 hours or six months, whichever comes first OR when the machine fails to lift the maximum rated load.

Testing the platform overload system regularly is essential to safe machine operation. Continued use of an improperly operating platform overload system could result in the system not sensing an overloaded platform condition. Machine stability could be compromised resulting in the machine tipping over.

The platform overload system is designed to prevent machine operation in the event the machine is overloaded. Models equipped with the platform overload option are provided with two additional machine control components:  
- **Overload pressure switch**  
- **Maximum height limit switch**  

The **overload pressure switch**, which is adjustable and located at the barrel-end of the lift cylinder, is used to determine when the hydraulic lift cylinder requires too much pressure to support the load inside the platform. When this occurs, the pressure switch will send a signal to the ECM, which will not allow the machine to function until the extra weight is removed from the platform.

The **maximum height limit switch**, located in the middle of the drive chassis under the scissor arms, is used to disable the lift valve coil when the platform is near maximum height. When activated, the limit switch keeps the lift cylinder from going over lift relief which would cause the pressure switch to falsely indicate an overload condition.

### Components:
- **a** Overload pressure switch  
- **b** Maximum height limit switch  

### Procedure:
1. Locate the lift valve coil on the function manifold.
2. Tag and disconnect the black and white wires of the up limit switch wire harness from the blue/black wires of the manifold wire harness at the lift valve coil on the manifold.

## Platform Controls  
**REV B**  

The platform controls, used to operate the machine from the platform or while standing on the ground, can also be used to tune the performance of the machine.  

Moving the joystick or activating a button or toggle switch sends a signal to the Electronic Control Module (ECM). When the ECM is in the function mode, the platform controls are used to operate the various machine functions. When the ECM is in the programming mode (PS is shown in the diagnostic display window), the platform controls are used to adjust the function speed parameters.  

The platform controls contain an electronic circuit board, joystick, membrane decal, buttons, switches, and LEDs. Potentiometer-equipped joysticks can be adjusted to maintain performance.  

For further information or assistance, consult the Genie Industries Service Department.

### 3-4 Platform Overload System  

#### Calibrate the Platform Overload System (if equipped)  

On machines with platform overload systems, proper calibration is essential to safe machine operation. An improperly calibrated platform overload system could result in the system failing to sense an overloaded platform. The stability of the machine is compromised and it could tip over.  

> **NOTICE**  
> Perform this procedure after fully charging the batteries.  

> **NOTICE**  
> Perform this procedure with toggle position 4 and 5 of DIP switch SW25, located in the platform control box, set to the on position.  

> **NOTICE**  
> Perform this procedure after confirming that the maximum height limit switch and the limit switch bracket are not damaged and are functioning correctly.  

> **NOTICE**  
> Be sure the hydraulic oil level is between the **FULL** and **ADD** marks on the hydraulic tank.  

### Steps to Calibrate the Platform Overload System  

1. Apply a thin layer of dry film lubricant to the area of the chassis where the scissor arm wear pads make contact.  
2. Chock both sides of the wheels at the steer end of the machine.  
3. Using a suitable lifting device, place a test weight, corresponding to the maximum load as indicated on the capacity indicator decal, in the center of the platform floor. Secure the weight to the platform. Refer to the chart below.  

   | Model   | Maximum Load (kg) |
   |---------|------------------|
   | GS-2032 | 677              |

6. Raise the platform until the position indicator corresponds to the maximum load position of the capacity indicator decal on the platform. Release the toggle switch.  

> **⚠ DANGER**  
> Tip-over hazard. Raising the platform with maximum load above the maximum load position, as shown on the capacity indicator decal on the side of the platform, could result in the machine tipping over, resulting in death or serious injury. **Do not raise the platform above the maximum load position of the capacity indicator decal on the side of the platform.**  

> **NOTICE**  
> To perform this step, the lift relief valve will need to be adjusted.  

7. Lift the safety arm, move it to the center of the scissor arm and rotate down to a vertical position.  
8. Remove the cover from the platform overload pressure switch box. Using a wrench, turn the nut of the platform overload pressure switch into the hydraulic line in 90° increments until the overload alarm does not sound.  

> **NOTICE**  
> To allow the platform overload system to reset, the red Emergency Stop button must be cycled after each quarter turn of the nut.  

> **NOTICE**  
> Turning the nut into the hydraulic line will deactivate the alarm; turning the nut out of the hydraulic line will activate the alarm.

## Hydraulic Pump  

### 5-1 Function Pump  
The hydraulic pump is attached to an electric motor which makes up the Hydraulic Power Unit.  

## How to Test the Hydraulic Pump  

> **NOTICE**  
> When removing a hose assembly or fitting, the O-ring on the fitting and/or hose end must be replaced and then torqued to specification during installation. Refer to Section Two, *Hydraulic Hose and Fitting Torque Specifications*.  

1. Disconnect and plug the high pressure hydraulic hose from the hydraulic pump.  

   > **WARNING**  
   > **Bodily injury hazard.** Spraying hydraulic oil can penetrate and burn skin. Loosen hydraulic connections very slowly to allow the oil pressure to dissipate gradually. Do not allow oil to squirt or spray.  

2. Connect a 0 to 5000 psi / 0 to 350 bar pressure gauge to the high pressure port on the pump.  

3. Turn the key switch to ground control and pull out the Emergency Stop button to the **ON** position at both the ground and platform controls.  

4. Activate the platform up function from the ground controls.  

   - **Result:** If the pressure gauge reads **3200 psi / 221 bar**, immediately stop. The pump is good.  
   - **Result:** If pressure fails to reach **3200 psi / 221 bar**, the pump is bad and will need to be serviced or replaced.  

   > **CAUTION**  
   > **Component damage hazard.** There is no relief valve in the hydraulic pump and the pump can be damaged if the pressure is allowed to exceed **3200 psi / 221 bar**. When testing the pump, activate the pump in one second intervals until **3200 psi / 221 bar** is confirmed. Do not over-pressurize the pump.  

5. Remove the pressure gauge and reconnect the hydraulic hose.  

   > **WARNING**  
   > **Bodily injury hazard.** Spraying hydraulic oil can penetrate and burn skin. Loosen hydraulic connections very slowly to allow the oil pressure to dissipate gradually. Do not allow oil to squirt or spray.

# How to Remove the Hydraulic Pump

**NOTICE**  
When removing a hose assembly or fitting, the O-ring on the fitting and/or hose end must be replaced and then torqued to specification during installation. Refer to Section Two, *Hydraulic Hose and Fitting Torque Specifications*.

1. Remove the mounting fasteners from the hydraulic filter bracket at the function manifold. Move the filter off to the side.
2. Tag, disconnect, and plug the hydraulic hoses on the pump. Cap the fittings on the pump.  

   **WARNING**  
   Bodily injury hazard. Spraying hydraulic oil can penetrate and burn skin. Loosen hydraulic connections very slowly to allow the oil pressure to dissipate gradually. Do not allow oil to squirt or spray.

3. Remove the pump mounting bolts. Carefully remove the pump.

            <td>500 lbs (227 kg)</td>
         </tr>
      </tbody>
   </table>  

3. Turn the key switch to ground control and pull out the red Emergency Stop button to the ON position at both the ground and platform controls.  
4. Hold the system relief valve with a wrench and remove the cap (item AF).  
5. While activating the platform up function, adjust the internal hex socket clockwise to increase lift capacity or counterclockwise to decrease lift capacity. Adjust the relief valve until the platform just begins to raise.  
6. Fully lower the platform.  
7. Add an additional 50 pounds / 22.7 kg to the platform. Secure the additional weight.  
8. Activate the platform up function.  

   - **Result:** The power unit should not be able to lift the platform.  
   - **Result:** If the power unit lifts the platform, adjust the internal hex socket counterclockwise until the platform will not raise.  

   > **⚠ DANGER**  
   > Tip-over hazard. Do not adjust the relief valve to allow the power unit to lift more than maximum rated load.  

9. Install the relief valve cap.  
10. Remove the weight from the platform.  
11. Bleed the hydraulic system. Raise the platform to full height, and then lower it to the stowed position through two complete cycles.  

   - **Result:** If the pump cavitates or platform fails to reach full height, add hydraulic oil until the pump is functioning correctly and the platform reaches full height. Do not overfill the hydraulic tank.  

   > **⚠ CAUTION**  
   > Component damage hazard. Do not continue to operate the machine if the hydraulic pump is cavitating. If the pump is still cavitating, see 5-1, *How to Test the Hydraulic Pump*.

### 6-7 Valve Coils  

## How to Test a Coil  

A properly functioning coil provides an electromotive force which operates the solenoid valve. Critical to normal operation is continuity within the coil that provides this force field.  

> ⚠ **WARNING**  
> Electrocution hazard. Contact with electrically charged circuits could result in death or serious injury. Remove all rings, watches and other jewelry.  

1. Tag and disconnect the wire harness from the coil to be tested.  
2. Test the coil resistance.  

   - **Result:** The resistance should be within specification, plus or minus 30%.  
   - **Result:** If the resistance is not within specification, plus or minus 30%, replace the coil.

# How to Test a Coil Diode

**Genie** incorporates spike suppressing diodes in all of its coils. Properly functioning coil diodes protect the electrical circuit by suppressing voltage spikes. Voltage spikes naturally occur within a function circuit following the interruption of electrical current to a coil. Faulty diodes can fail to protect the electrical system, resulting in a tripped circuit breaker or component damage.

## ⚠ WARNING  
**Electrocution hazard.** Contact with electrically charged circuits could result in death or serious injury. Remove all rings, watches, and other jewelry.

### Steps to Test a Coil Diode

1. **Test the coil for resistance.** See *6-8 How to Test a Coil*.
2. **Connect a 10Ω resistor** to the negative terminal of a known good 9V DC battery. Connect the other end of the resistor to a terminal on the coil.  

   > **NOTICE**  
   > The battery should read 9V DC or more when measured across the terminals.

   **Resistor, 10Ω**  
   *Genie part number:* **27287**

3. **Set a multimeter to read DC amperage.**  

   > **NOTICE**  
   > The multimeter, when set to read DC amperage, should be capable of reading up to 800 mA.

4. **Connect the negative lead** to the other terminal on the coil.  

   > **NOTICE**  
   > If testing a single-terminal coil, connect the negative lead to the internal metallic ring at either end of the coil.

5. **Momentarily connect the positive lead** from the multimeter to the positive terminal on the 9V battery. Note and record the current reading.
6. **Reverse the connections** at the battery or coil terminals. Note and record the current reading.

### Results Interpretation

- **If both current readings are greater than 0 mA and differ by a minimum of 20%**, the coil is good.
- **If one or both of the current readings are 0 mA, or if the two current readings do not differ by a minimum of 20%**, the coil and/or its internal diode are faulty and the coil should be replaced.

# Section 5 Troubleshooting Flow Charts  
**June 2004**  

## TROUBLESHOOTING FLOW CHARTS  

### About This Section  
When a malfunction is discovered, the flow charts in this section will help a service professional pinpoint the cause of the problem. To use this section, basic hand tools and certain pieces of test equipment are required—voltmeter, ohmmeter, pressure gauges.  

The location of terminals mentioned in this section can be found on the appropriate electrical or hydraulic schematics provided in **Section 6, Schematics**.  

Since various degrees of a particular function loss may occur, selecting the appropriate flow chart may be troublesome. When a function will not operate with the same speed or power as a machine in good working condition, refer to the flow chart which most closely describes the problem.

### Troubleshooting Steps  

1. **Chock the wheels** at the steer end of the machine.  
2. **Jack the non-steer end** of the machine up approximately 4 inches (10 cm) and place jack stands under the machine for support.  
3. **Turn the brake release knob (Item A)** counterclockwise all the way and pump the hand pump (Item C) fully 13-15 times or until much resistance is felt.  
4. **Turn each wheel by hand**. Each wheel should turn freely without much effort.  

#### Decision Point: Do the wheels turn?  

- **If wheels turn:**  
  - **Turn the brake release valve (Item A) clockwise** all the way and try to rotate the wheels.  
  - **If wheels turn:**  
    - Rebuild or replace the brakes OR replace the brake release valve (Item A) OR consult the Genie Industries Service Department.  
  - **If wheels do not turn:**  
    - Attempt to drive the machine in either direction and have an assistant try to rotate the non-steer wheels. This will require 2 people.  
    - **If wheels turn:**  
      - If the machine still does not drive at full speed with the platform in the stowed position, replace the platform controls, replace the platform controls circuit board OR replace the ECM U5 OR consult the Genie Industries Service Department.  
    - **If wheels do not turn:**  
      - Plumb a 0 to 500 psi (35 bar) gauge into the hose from the function manifold to the brake. Attempt to drive the machine in either direction and read the pressure on the gauge.  
      - **If pressure is between 200 to 300 psi:**  
        - Pressure is good. Replace the brakes OR consult the Genie Industries Service Department.  
      - **If pressure is less than 200 psi:**  
        - Replace the shuttle valve (Item B) OR replace the brake release valve (Item A) OR the function manifold or brake release manifold may have an internal defect OR consult the Genie Industries Service Department.  
      - **If pressure is between 200 to 300 psi:**  
        - Pressure is good. Replace the brakes OR consult the Genie Industries Service Department.

Be sure the batteries are fully charged and properly connected.

---

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **With the key switch turned to platform controls and both Emergency Stop buttons pulled out to the ON position and the machine on incline LED activated**, check for voltage on the positive terminal at the Drive speed select valve coil (item AJ or BI or CJ).

   - **0V**  
     - Check for continuity in the WH-C 8-Pi coil wire from the ECM U5 to the drive speed select coil (item AJ or BI or CJ).
       - **No continuity** → Repair or replace the WH-C 8-Pi coil wire from the ECM U5 to the drive speed select coil.
       - **Continuity** → Replace U5 OR consult the Genie Industries Service Department.

   - **20V or more**  
     - Check for continuity in the brown ground wire circuit from the drive speed select valve coil (item AJ or BI or CJ) to ground.
       - **No continuity** → Repair or replace the ground wire circuit from the drive speed select coil to ground.
       - **Continuity**  
         - Disconnect the wires from the drive speed select valve coil (item AJ or BI or CJ) and check resistance of the coil. See Repair Section.
           - **18 to 20 ohms** → Consult the Genie Industries Service Department.
           - **0 or infinite ohms** → Replace the drive speed select valve coil (item AJ or BI or CJ).
