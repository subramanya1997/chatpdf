## SAFETY RULES

### Personal Safety

Any person working on or around a machine must be aware of all known safety hazards. Personal safety and the continued safe operation of the machine should be your top priority.

Read each procedure thoroughly. This manual and the decals on the machine use signal words to identify the following:

- **Safety alert symbol**‚Äîused to alert personnel to potential personal injury hazards. Obey all safety messages that follow this symbol to avoid possible injury or death.

- **DANGER (Red)**‚Äîused to indicate the presence of an imminently hazardous situation which, if not avoided, will result in death or serious injury.

- **WARNING (Orange)**‚Äîused to indicate the presence of a potentially hazardous situation which, if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury.

- **CAUTION (Yellow with safety alert symbol)**‚Äîused to indicate the presence of a potentially hazardous situation which, if not avoided, may cause minor or moderate injury.

- **CAUTION (Yellow without safety alert symbol)**‚Äîused to indicate the presence of a potentially hazardous situation which, if not avoided, may result in property damage.

- **NOTICE (Green)**‚Äîused to indicate operation or maintenance information.

Be sure to wear protective eye wear and other protective clothing if the situation warrants it.

Be aware of potential crushing hazards such as moving parts and free swinging or unsecured components when lifting or placing loads. Always wear approved steel-toed shoes.

### Workplace Safety

- Be sure to keep sparks, flames and lighted tobacco away from flammable and combustible materials such as battery gases and engine fuels. Always have an approved fire extinguisher within easy reach.

- Be sure that all tools and working areas are properly maintained and ready for use. Keep work surfaces clean and free of debris that could get into machine components and cause damage.

- Be sure that your workshop or work area is properly ventilated and well lit.

- Be sure any forklift, overhead crane or other lifting or supporting device is fully capable of supporting and stabilizing the weight to be lifted. Use only chains or straps that are in good condition and of ample capacity.

- Be sure that fasteners intended for one-time use (i.e., cotter pins and self-locking nuts) are not reused. These components may fail if they are used a second time.

- Be sure to properly dispose of old oil or other fluids. Use an approved container. Please be environmentally safe.

## Theory of Operation

### Power Source
The Genie GS-1530 and GS-1930 machines are powered by four six-volt (255 AH) batteries. The four batteries are wired in series to produce 24 volts.

### Hydraulic System
All machine functions are performed by the hydraulic system. The hydraulic system is powered by a single-section gear pump. When the pump is activated, it supplies hydraulic fluid under pressure to the function manifold, where the control valves are located. To protect from over-pressurization of the hydraulic system, the pump is provided with a pressure relief valve.

Activating a machine function is accomplished by actuating or moving a switch and/or control handle, which sends voltage to the ECM. The ECM then sends the signal to the appropriate directional control valve. The directional valve determines which direction the hydraulic fluid will travel. Computer software determines the volume of fluid in relation to the proportional valve input voltage.

### Electrical System
Limit switches are found in various locations on the machine. The function of a limit switch is to communicate the operating position of the machine to the ECM (Electronic Control Module). When a change in signal is received from a limit switch, the ECM responds by limiting the drive speed to 0.5 miles per hour (0.8 km/h), according to the default settings in the ECM software.

### Machine Controls
The GS-1530 and GS-1930 machines are equipped with operational controls which are found in two locations: the ground controls, located on the hydraulic tank side of the machine, and the platform controls, located in the platform. All lift and drive functions are available at the platform controls. Only platform up/down functions are available at the ground controls. The ECM uses input from the ground or platform controls to activate the various machine functions. The ECM has predetermined settings for the various machine functions.

The joystick is fitted with a 5000 ohm potentiometer. With the joystick in the neutral position, the potentiometer will measure 2730 ohms. These signals are sent to the multiplex card, then down to the ECM to control the voltage supplied to the proportional valve. Two microswitches mounted on the joystick tell the ECM the drive direction desired. A thumb rocker switch on the top of the joystick is used for steering.

Mounted on the platform control box lid of machines before serial number 17408 are buttons and a switch that, when activated, sends a signal to the ECM through the multiplex card. On machines after serial number 17407, the platform control box lid has a decal/membrane pad. This is a touch-activated pad incorporating wiring, switches and LEDs that are resistant to the environment. Activating any of the buttons on the pad will send a signal to the ECM through the multiplex card.

A diagnostic display is located at the battery pack side of the machine to aid in troubleshooting. If the machine malfunctions, a fault code will be shown in the display window.

> **CAUTION**  
> Washing electronic components is not suggested. Instead, use compressed air to remove debris from these components.  
> **Component damage hazard. Avoid shock or impact to the ECM. Internal damage may not be visible from the outside.**

# Hydraulic Hose and Fitting Torque Specifications  

Your machine is equipped with either 37¬∞ flared fittings and hose ends OR Parker Seal-Lok¬Æ fittings and hose ends. Machines that utilize Parker Seal-Lok¬Æ hoses and fittings require that the fittings and hose ends be torqued to specification when they are removed and installed or when new hoses or fittings are installed. Machines equipped with 37¬∞ flared fittings and hose ends do not need to be torqued to these specifications.

## Torque Procedure  

1. **Replace the O-ring.** The O-ring must be replaced anytime the seal has been broken. The O-ring cannot be re-used if the fitting or hose end has been tightened beyond finger tight.  

   > **NOTICE**  
   > The O-rings used in the Parker Seal Lok¬Æ fittings and hose ends are a custom-size O-ring. They are not a standard SAE size O-ring. They are available in the O-ring field service kit (Genie part number 49612).  

2. **Lubricate the O-ring before installation.**  
3. **Be sure that the face seal O-ring is seated and retained properly.**  
4. **Position the tube and nut squarely on the face seal end of the fitting and tighten the nut finger tight.**  
5. **Tighten the nut or fitting to the appropriate torque per given size as shown in the table above.**  
6. **Operate all machine functions and inspect the connections.**

# Section 4 - Scheduled Maintenance Procedures  
**Service Manual - First Edition**  

## Table A Procedures  

### A-1 Inspect the Operator‚Äôs and Safety Manuals  

Maintaining the operator‚Äôs and safety manuals in good condition is essential to safe machine operation. Manuals are included with each machine and should be stored in the container provided in the platform. An illegible or missing manual will not provide safety and operational information necessary for a safe operating condition.  

1. Check to be sure the storage container is present and in good condition.  
2. Check to make sure that the operator‚Äôs, responsibilities, and safety manuals are present and complete in the storage container in the platform.  
3. Examine the pages of each manual to be sure that they are legible and in good condition.  
4. Always return the manuals to the storage container after use.  

> **NOTICE**  
> Contact your authorized Genie distributor or Genie Industries if replacement manuals are needed.  

### A-2 Inspect the Decals and Placards  

Maintaining all of the safety and instructional decals and placards in good condition is mandatory for safe machine operation. Decals alert operators and personnel to the many possible hazards associated with using this machine. They also provide users with operation and maintenance information. An illegible decal will fail to alert personnel of a procedure or hazard and could result in unsafe operating conditions.  

1. Refer to the *Decals* section in the appropriate *Genie GS-1530 & Genie GS-1930 Operator's Manual* and use the decal list and illustrations to determine that all decals and placards are in place.  
2. Inspect all decals for legibility and damage. Replace any damaged or illegible decal immediately.  

> **NOTICE**  
> Contact your authorized Genie distributor or Genie Industries if replacement decals are needed.

### B-9 Test the Drive Speed - Raised Position  

Proper drive functions are essential to safe machine operation. The drive function should respond quickly and smoothly to operator control. Drive performance should also be free of hesitation, jerking, and unusual noise over the entire proportionally controlled speed range.  

> **NOTICE**  
> Select a test area that is firm, level, and free of obstructions.  

1. Create start and finish lines by marking two lines on the ground 40 feet (12.2 m) apart.  
2. Turn the key switch to platform control and pull out the Emergency Stop button to the ON position at both the ground and platform controls.  
3. Raise the platform approximately 6 feet (2 m).  
4. Choose a point on the machine; i.e., contact patch of a tire, as a visual reference for use when crossing the start and finish lines.  
5. Bring the machine to maximum drive speed before reaching the start line. Begin timing when your reference point on the machine crosses the start line.  
6. Continue at full speed and note the time when the machine reference point passes over the finish line. Return the control handle to center.  

**Drive speed (maximum):**  

| Platform raised | 40 ft / 55 sec | 12.2 m / 55 sec |

# Table D Procedure  

## D-1 Test or Replace the Hydraulic Oil  

Replacement or testing of the hydraulic oil is essential for good machine performance and service life. Dirty oil and suction strainer may cause the machine to perform poorly and continued use may cause component damage. Extremely dirty conditions may require oil changes to be performed more often.  

**NOTICE**  
This machine uses Dexron equivalent hydraulic oil. Before replacing the hydraulic oil, the oil may be tested by an oil distributor for specific levels of contamination to verify that changing the oil is necessary. **If the hydraulic oil is not replaced at the two-year inspection, test the oil quarterly. Replace the oil when it fails the test.**  

**NOTICE**  
Perform this procedure with the platform in the stowed position.  

1. Disconnect the battery pack from the machine.  
2. Open the power unit compartment and place a drain pan or other suitable container under the hydraulic tank.  
3. Remove the drain plug from the hydraulic tank.  

   **WARNING**  
   Bodily injury hazard. Spraying hydraulic oil can penetrate and burn skin. Loosen hydraulic connections very slowly to allow the oil pressure to dissipate gradually. Do not allow oil to squirt or spray.  

4. Completely drain the tank into a suitable container. See capacity specifications listed above.  
5. Remove the return filter mounting bracket fasteners from the manifold. Push the filter and accumulator out of the way.  
6. Remove the motor controller mounting bracket retaining fasteners and move the motor controller to the side.  
7. Remove the hydraulic tank from the machine.  
8. Remove the suction strainer and clean it using a mild solvent.  
9. Clean the inside of the hydraulic tank using a mild solvent.  
10. Install the suction strainer using thread sealer on the threads.  
11. Install the drain plug using thread sealer on the threads.  
12. Install the hydraulic filter bracket and the Curtis motor controller bracket.  

   **WARNING**  
   Electrocution hazard. The connectors on the motor controller will short out to ground if the motor controller mounting bracket is not installed before the battery pack is connected.  

13. Install the hydraulic tank.  
14. Fill the tank with hydraulic oil until the fluid is within the **FULL** and **ADD** marks on the oil level indicator decal. Do not overfill.  
15. Clean up any oil that may have spilled. Properly discard of oil.

# Platform Controls  

## 1-1 Platform Controller  

The platform controller is controlled by an ECM (Electronic Control Module) located in the battery pack module tray. It is a fully self-contained unit which is capable of recognizing machine malfunctions with on-board diagnostics and displays a fault code on a digital display on the ECM. This aids in troubleshooting the machine by pinpointing the fault or malfunction. See the Troubleshooting section of this manual for a list of fault codes and additional information. The ECM is not user-serviceable. For further information or assistance, consult the Genie Industries Service Department.

## Section 7 - Repair Procedures  

### PLATFORM CONTROLS  

## 1-2 Software Configuration  

The ECM (Electronic Control Module) contains programming for all configurations of the GS-1530 and GS-1930. The platform controls can be adjusted to a different configuration by changing the combination of the DIP switch settings. The DIP switch is located on the circuit board inside the platform control box.  

DIP switches have two positions - **ON** or **OFF**. When reading the DIP switch code in the *DIP Switch Code Chart*, the **ON** and **OFF** are represented by the numbers **1 (ON)** and **0 (OFF)**.  

> **NOTICE**  
> Select a test area that is firm, level and free of obstructions.  

> **NOTICE**  
> Models before serial number **17408** were not adjustable when they were shipped from the factory. If the ECM (Electronic Control Module) has been updated to revision **"b0"** or later, or if the model's serial number is after **17407**, you can access the revision level of the ECM by using the following procedure:  

---

## How to Determine the Revision Level  

1. **Remove the platform controls from the platform.**  

2. **Turn the key switch to platform control and pull out the Emergency Stop buttons to the ON position at both the ground and platform controls.**  

3. **Press and hold the lift enable button and the function enable switch. Move the joystick handle to the UP position to raise the platform. Observe the code shown in the LED display window, located on the battery pack side of the machine.**  

   - **Result:** The configuration code of the DIP switch will appear in the LED display window.  

4. **Press and hold the lift enable button and the function enable switch. Move the joystick handle to the DOWN position to lower the platform. Observe the code shown in the LED display window, located on the battery pack side of the machine.**  

   - **Result:** The software revision level will appear in the LED display window. If revision level **"b0"** appears in the display window, the procedure under *How to Set the DIP Switch Codes* on the next page will apply. If revision level **"A"** is displayed, the procedure will not apply.  

5. **Push in the Emergency Stop button to the OFF position at both the ground and platform controls and turn the key switch to the OFF position.**

## PLATFORM CONTROLS  

### 1-3 Toggle Switches  

Toggle switches used for single function switching are single pole double throw (SPDT) switches. Dual function switching requires a double pole double throw (DPDT) switch.  

## How to Test a Toggle Switch  

> **NOTICE**  
> Continuity is the equivalent of 0 to 3 ohms. A simple continuity tester may not accurately test the switch.  

This procedure covers fundamental switch testing and does not specifically apply to all varieties of toggle switches.  

1. Turn the key switch to the OFF position. Tag and disconnect all wiring from the toggle switch to be tested.  
   > **NOTICE**  
   > The toggle switch at the platform controls requires that the wires are unplugged from the main circuit board before testing.  

2. Connect the leads of an ohmmeter to the switch terminals in the following combinations listed below to check for continuity.
