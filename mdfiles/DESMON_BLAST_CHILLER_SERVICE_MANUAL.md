<sup>1</sup> The pressure switch in this model series provides a single output, open or closed. The circuit is normally open and will close when either the High or Low Pressure limits are reached. In effect, the failure code, HP, could mean either high discharge pressure as well as low suction pressure.

<sup>2</sup> Additional troubleshooting at the Key Pad – Control Module connections:

- **No Ground connection** – Display flashes and/or dims  
- **No Negative (-) connection** – Display may work normally without failure code  
- **No Positive (+) connection** – Failure Code Error is displayed  
- **No 12V connection** – Display will not light up.

# 1.3.3 Temperature Probes Display

To check the reading of the unit’s temperature sensing probes, first make sure the unit is in the OFF mode.

1. Press the NEEDLE PROBE key and the DOWN arrow key together and hold for five (5) seconds.
2. To scroll through the reading use the UP or DOWN arrow key.

### Probe Display Table

<table>

<tr><td>Pr2</td><td>Needle Probe</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pr3</td><td>Evaporator Probe</td></tr>

Valuable information can be obtained by checking the evaporator probe when the unit is struggling to reach the cabinet temperature setpoint (i.e., -40°F). This may indicate that the evaporator coil is not being supplied with sufficient refrigerant. 

With a cabinet setpoint of -40°F, the actual evaporator temperature is approximately -45°C at 0 Barg. In this case, the controller evaporator probe reading **MUST BE** at least -42°C, which is the minimum readable temperature.

## HACCP PRINTER

Blast Chillers can be ordered with an optional printer, or one can be installed as a retrofit. The printer has its own power supply connection (110VAC – 240VAC 50/60 Hz). The printer is connected to the Main Board at the second RS 485 connection port (shown).

# Blast Chiller Service Manual

## Printer Connection Instructions

A Belden shielded cable (3 wires) must be used.

### Connection Setup

Connect the printer to the Main Board using coaxial shielded cables. The main controller must be set to recognize the printer and enable communication. 

Set configuration parameter **P71** to **1** to enable the printer port on the Main Board. In addition, ensure that the following parameters are set as shown:

- **P76** – 1  
- **P75** – 2  

### Printer Status Indication

An LED on the printer will indicate its status:

- **RED = ON**  

Press the **feed key** to output blank paper in either **ON** or **OFF** status.

# Printing Cycle Data

With the **HACCP printer**, it is also possible to print data history related to the freezing and chilling cycles.

If the printer is left **ON** and a cycle is started, the data will be captured.  
Data capture frequency is set in **Parameter P72** (example: If **P72 = 1**, the device will print every minute) and provide the following information:

- Type of cycle  
- Start date and time  
- Time, Cabinet, and Needle Probe temperatures (each capture line)

## 2. Basic Service Diagnostic (Touch Screen Controller)

The Touch Screen Controller will display alarms that will assist in identifying the cause of a problem and direct attention to the components and circuits involved. In addition, a diagnostic service menu allows technicians to quickly check the temperature sensors (such as the needle probe, the chamber probe or the evaporator probe), the relay status, the door switch input and many other things.

<tr>
<th>ALARM MESSAGE</th>
<th>NOTES/CONSEQUENCES</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DOOR</strong></td>
<td>The door is open for more than the allowed time during a cycle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>MAINTENANCE</strong></td>
<td>It's just a reminder to perform a regular service inspection and preventive maintenance. Call your A.S.A. for more information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>CONDENSER HIGH TEMPERATURE</strong></td>
<td>It means that the condenser temperature is too high compared to a normal working condition, defined by a temperature threshold. In this version of Blast Chiller, the alarm is not enabled, as the condenser probe is not installed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>HIGH PRESSURE</strong></td>
<td>Head pressure is too high, exceeding 29 barg (425 psig). Check for clogged condenser, condenser fan motor not running, or pump down valve not opening when the compressor is running.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>EVAPORATOR LOW TEMPERATURE</strong></td>
<td>It means that the evaporator temperature is too low compared to the current setpoint temperature. There is a differential parameter LBT that states the maximum gap that should exist between setpoint temperature and evaporator temperature. The alarm may occur on some occasions when there is a big change of setpoint temperature during a multistep automatic recipe, with the evaporator temperature remaining low for some minutes and hence triggering the alarm. This alarm is not a critical one; however, it could be avoided by setting LBT as high as possible (i.e., 40°C-72°F).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DEFROSTING TIME</strong></td>
<td>Means that the defrost process has not terminated within the maximum defrosting time. The defrost normally ends by coil temperature (DTE). If this doesn't happen within DTO minutes, then the alarm triggers. Check the evaporator coil icing status; one defrost may not be enough, then repeat the defrost. If the alarm occurs during the holding cycle, there may be a problem with the defrost device (hot gas valve). Using the Blast Chiller as a holding cabinet for a long time may also trigger this alarm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>ELECTRICAL FEEDING</strong></td>
<td>It means that the voltage supply is not within the safety range. The range is determined by parameter MRV (Main Reference Voltage), plus or minus 20%. Check the voltage actual reading from the Energy section during a cycle (for more details, see paragraph 2.4. Cycle Graph and other functions). Call Service if there is suspicion of low or high voltage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>LOW TEMPERATURE</strong></td>
<td>It occurs when, during the holding cycle, the air temperature goes below the lower temperature limit, parameter ALL. This parameter is a differential with respect to the setpoint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>HIGH TEMPERATURE</strong></td>
<td>It occurs when, during the holding cycle, the air temperature goes above the higher temperature limit, parameter ALH. This parameter is a differential with respect to the setpoint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>AIR PROBE (S1)</strong></td>
<td>Air probe failure. Call Service.</td>

# Blast Chiller Service Manual

## 3. Troubleshooting

**WARNING:** Before performing any service that involves electrical connection or disconnection and/or exposure to electrical components, always follow the Electrical LOCKOUT/TAGOUT Procedure. Disconnect all circuits. **Failure to comply can cause property damage, injury, or death.**

If, upon first inspection, the cause of a problem is not obvious, a more thorough troubleshooting may be necessary. The unit may need to be unplugged or otherwise removed from the power supply so the internal components can be tested.

### 3.1. *PROBES*

The Blast Chiller is equipped with several temperature sensing probes. These probes are Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermoset sensors. The chamber and evaporator probes have the same configuration. The Touch Screen version has a special multicore needle probe (5 cores, but only 4 being read from the board).

#### ROOM/EVAPORATOR PROBE TYPE

| NTC PROBE | BULB | PROBE MEASURING |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| ![NTC Probe](image1.jpg) | ![Bulb](image2.jpg) | ![Probe Measuring](image3.jpg) |

#### NTC NEEDLE PROBE TYPES

| Needle Probe Type 1 | Needle Probe Type 2 |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| ![Needle Probe 1](image4.jpg) | ![Needle Probe 2](image5.jpg) |

The needle probe has a different sensing element. Both types of probes have the same resistance to temperature correlation.

# Pt1000 NEEDLE PROBE TYPES (MULTICORE)

![Pt1000 Needle Probe](image.jpg)

## 3.1.1. Checking the Probes

When a Probe alarm occurs, it means there is something wrong with the sensor reading. The problem may be in either the sensor wires or the sensor itself. Probe alarms Er0, Er1, and Er3 (or error messages as per Touch Screen alarm list at 2.1.) are commonly due to an interrupted (open) circuit in the wires.  
The cause may also be a short to the chassis or the two leads shorting together.

To find the cause of the alarm, disconnect the indicated probe and check the resistance between the two wires (or between any of the 5 wires of a multiprobe type).

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>If the Ohm reading is</th>
<th>Condition</th>
<th>Action</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>Probe circuit is shorted between the two wires</td>
<td>Replace the probe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Infinity, ∞</td>
<td>Probe is open</td>
<td>Replace the probe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matches the resistance chart at a known temperature</td>
<td>Probe is good</td>
<td>Another problem is the cause</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not 0 or ∞ and does not match the resistance chart</td>
<td>Probe is out of range</td>
<td>Replace the probe</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If none of these choices is the case:  
Ohm out each wire to the chassis. If the reading is 0 or anything less than ∞, the probe is shorted to the chassis and must be replaced.

> **NOTE:** A spare probe can be used in place of the suspected one. If the alarm continues, the problem is something other than the probe.

Other causes of the Probe Alarms may be searched in the probe-to-board terminal connection. Check for rust, water, humidity, loosened/lost connections on the probe terminal block.

# Blast Chiller Service Manual

If none of the above causes is found, the problem may exist in the main board internal circuits or in the mother board processor. The main board should be replaced.

## 3.2. DOOR SWITCH

The Blast Chiller is equipped with a magnetic door switch. Opening the door is detected by a magnetic sensor. When the door is closed, the sensor is activated by a magnet built into the door. There are two magnets in each door, one at the top and one at the bottom. This allows the door to be reversed (only for non-Touch Screen version).

## 3.2.1 Checking the door switch

If the magnetic sensor is faulty or if the wires are broken or shorted, the display will show **“d-r”** continuously. 

To check the switch:
1. Disconnect the wires from the Main Board at terminals **48 & 49**.
2. Ohm out the switch between the two wires.
3. The switch should be **closed when a magnet is present** and **open when it is not**.

If the switch tests OK:
- Check for corroded, loose, or missing connections on the terminals.
- If no problem is found in the switch or wires, replace the **Main Board**.

### 3.3. PRESSURE SWITCH

There is a pressure regulating switch installed to prevent compressor failures or improper operation due to high discharge pressure. Self-contained models have a high-pressure switch only, while remote units have a double switch, like the one shown below. In the old models, both types of applications had a double switch, triggering alarm “hp” either for a low or high-pressure event. In some recent remote applications, the pressure switch is used for pump-down purposes also.

#### 3.3.1 Pressure Switch Working Principles – Alarm Connection

The pressure switch has normally closed contacts that will open if the High or Low pressure limits are exceeded. The switch is connected to the Main Board at terminals **48 & 50** in the case of a standard controller (**48** is a shared connection with the door switch), and terminals **GND & D1** in the Touch Screen version. When the pressure switch opens from either a high or low-pressure condition, the display will show the error code **“hP”** (or message **“HIGH PRESSURE”** in the Touch Screen version).

# Blast Chiller Service Manual

## TOUCH SCREEN VERSION

Newest self-contained models (D.O.M. above January 2014) will only have a high-pressure switch. Once the pressures return to the normal range, the pressure switch will reset automatically. The newest remote application (D.O.M. above January 2015) won’t have an alarm connection with the pressure switch but will be used to pump down by low pressure or to cut out the compressor in case of high pressure.

### 3.3.2 Pressure Switch Working Principles – Pump Down

Remote applications are equipped with a double pressure switch. A solenoid valve is used to feed refrigerant to the evaporator. This valve will be closed when the setpoint temperature is reached in the cabinet, allowing the compressor to pump down until the pressure switch trips due to low suction pressure. The pressure switch will cut out the compressor contactor’s coil in this case, either for low pressure (pump down) or high pressure (safety).

> **NOTE:** No high-pressure alarm message will be displayed from the controller in case of remote chillers working in pump-down configuration.

### 3.3.3 Pressure Switch Factory Setting

The factory setting for the pressure switch is as follows. **Do not change these settings!**

- **High pressure limit** = 29 barg (425 psig)  
- **Low pressure limit** = 0 barg (0 psig)  
- **Differential** = 1.2 barg (18 psig)  

### 3.4 DOOR FRAME HEATER

Both Shock Freezer and Blast Chiller units come equipped with a door frame heater to prevent frost build-up on the door gasket. The heater may be either **115V or 220V** depending on the model/rating. 

For **220V 3-phase units** (or **220V single-phase units with no neutral**), the door frame heater is connected between two live mains. The heater runs around the frame, under a plastic strip cover. Electrical connections run through the lower cabinet panel to the electrical component box.

Depending on the unit’s voltage rating, each load is directly connected to either L1 or Neutral. L2 is switched by the dedicated relay.

---

### 3.5.1 **Checking Relay Outputs**

When a component is not running it may be useful to understand if the related relay output is working properly. The relays should cut-in and off according to the logic sequences of the controller. 

To check an output, just disconnect the input Line to the relay and the output wire (e.g., to check K10 disconnect both wires on 19 and 20 terminals). Ohm out the relay terminals and check if the contact is closed when the relay is activated. A faulty relay may remain always open or become shorted. When this occurs, replace the board.

# Blast Chiller Service Manual

## 3.9. **REFRIGERANT PRESSURES CHECKS**

High or Low refrigerant pressure levels are dependent on:

- Ambient temperature
- Heat load in the cabinet (Full or Empty)
- Status of the cycle (hot food, frozen food etc.)
- Cabinet temperature
- TX valve regulation
- Evaporator coil air flow
- Condenser coil air flow

Checking the High and Low pressures on the unit alone cannot determine if the unit is operating correctly. Careful analysis, based on the conditions listed above, is necessary to properly diagnose a problem.

For example: Checking the suction pressure results in a reading of 0.1 barg. This could be the correct pressure if the cabinet temperature is at the minimum (-40°C) and the evaporator temperature is at -45°C.

If this is not the case, the evaporator may not be getting sufficient refrigerant and the actual evaporator temperature could be much higher than -45°C. It is not recommended to base any troubleshooting conclusions solely on the pressure readings.

### **SUCTION PRESSURE: 0.1/0.2 barg**
This pressure should be measured when the cabinet temperature is at -40°C with the compressor running.

### **DISCHARGE PRESSURE: 16 barg**
This pressure can vary greatly and can reach up to 25 barg psig, depending on the ambient temperature and heat load inside the cabinet. Very high discharge pressures can cause the pressure switch to signal an alarm.

## 4.3.2 5 Shelves Units

These models do not come equipped with a sliding base plate for the condensing unit. All the components are mounted directly to a base plate which is part of the unit’s structure. The procedure for accessing these components is different from that for the model previously described. However, the first eight steps are the same.

1. Follow the instructions from (a) to (g) in the previous paragraph.
2. Unscrew the 8 bolts from the bottom of the cabinet (4 on each side).
3. In the front side, lift the cabinet up enough so the drain duct will clear the condenser coil.

When a Door Frame Heater stops working, it could be a problem with the heater, such as an open element or a short. The problem could also be an interrupted power supply. Test the power supply before replacing the heater. Test the heater using the following specifications:

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th></th><th>115V</th><th>220V</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Length</td><td>2.4 m</td><td>2 m (Heated)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Resistance</td><td>1.4 kΩ</td><td>2.4 kΩ</td></tr>
<tr><td>Current</td><td>80 mAmps</td><td>90 mAmps</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### To replace the heater:

1. Insert a thin knife blade between the edge of the plastic cover frame. You may need to tap lightly on the knife to insert it.  
2. Pry the strip up and out. Do this for all the strips.

# Blast Chiller Service Manual

## 5 VACUUM AND CHARGE PROCEDURE

**WARNING:** Before performing any service that involves electrical connection or disconnection and/or exposure to electrical components, always follow the Electrical LOCKOUT/TAGOUT Procedure. Disconnect all circuits. Failure to comply can cause property damage, injury, or death.  
This chapter deals with repairing/replacing instructions for both mechanical and electrical components.

Always perform a vacuum and charging procedure when any of the following actions have been done:

- Replacement of compressor  
- Replacement of solenoid valve body  
- Replacement of condenser  
- Replacement of evaporator  
- Replacement of thermal expansion valve  
- Replacement of liquid receiver or oil separator  
- Replacement of a filter  
- Leak repair  
- Replacement of tubing  
- Any action that involves opening the refrigeration system  

**NOTE:** Always replace the filter/drier before beginning a vacuum and charging procedure.  

**NOTE:** Refer to the Data Chart for the correct amount of refrigerant for each model.  

**NOTE:** Ensure all refrigerant is recovered before pulling a vacuum on the system.  
For the best results, pull the vacuum from more than one point in the system.  

### 5.1 VACUUM AND CHARGING INSTRUCTION

#### 5.1.1 Self Contained Models

Attach the vacuum pump to the compressor check pressure valve and liquid receiver valve (shown).

![Compressor Valve](image1.jpg)  
**COMPRESSOR VALVE**

## 5.1.2 Remote Models

Attach vacuum pump to the compressor check pressure valve and liquid receiver valve (shown above).  
A split evaporator unit is also equipped with one or more additional valves that can be used to pull a vacuum and charge the system. This valve can be used to pull a vacuum in the evaporator unit in two ways:

1. Pull a vacuum in the entire system with the condensing and evaporating units connected and recharge the entire system.
2. Because these units are equipped with refrigerant valves (or self-closing quick-connections in some models), the condensing section can be separated. A vacuum can be pulled and refrigerant can be charged in this section. A vacuum can then be pulled on the evaporator section. Connect both suction and liquid lines to the evaporator to pull a vacuum into them as well. Once the system has been pumped down, simply connect the lines to the condensing unit that has already been charged.

This last option is very helpful if only one side of the system is to be opened for repair. For example: if a compressor needs to be replaced, it’s not necessary to open the entire system. Simply disconnect the lines at **"Lc"** & **"Sc"** to remove the compressor.

### 5.1.3 Vacuum and Charging Recommendations

- Use a vacuum pump rated at 50gpm minimum.
- Pull the vacuum for 1½ hours minimum.
- Replace the filter/drier whenever the system has been opened.

## 6.3 CONNECTION OF REMOTE CABINET TO “NON-DESMON” CONDENSING UNIT

Blast Chiller cabinets without condensing unit can be connected to a remote existing condensing unit or a centralized system.

### 6.3.1 Connection with existing refrigerant lines

A feeding valve is already installed on the box of the cabinet, behind the liquid line quick connection. The feeding valve is internally connected to the controller, being activated when the unit demands for cooling.

#### ELECTRICAL BOX (TOP OF THE CABINET)

#### QUICK CONNECTIONS EVAPORATOR SIDE (TOP OF THE CABINET)

The quick fittings in the above picture are self-closing type, allowing hermetic seal of the evaporator circuit. The cabinet is already evacuated and tested in the factory, hence not requiring any evacuating procedure during the installation. Two spare female quick fittings matching with the above shown male fittings are provided in the package in order to allow connection with the refrigerant existing circuit. Some refrigerant is contained in the evaporator, therefore a sight glass is needed to determine the right amount of refrigerant when connecting the unit to an existing condensing unit.

### 6.3.2 Hook the electrical power to the unit

The Blast Chiller cabinet requires electrical power for the evaporator fans (4 or 5 for a single rack model), electronics controller, feeding valve, frame heater and similar. All the mentioned components are single phase, therefore the unit requires only two hot lines (or 1 line and neutral, depending on the mains voltage). The voltage among lines must be 208V or 220-240V, either 50 or 60 Hz. 

To hook the power to the cabinet, just open the electrical metal box on the top of the cabinet and connect L1 and L2 on the power block as shown below:

The wiring diagram is provided in a plastic bag in the electrical box.
