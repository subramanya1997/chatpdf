# SAFETY AND OPERATION PRECAUTIONS

Because an air compressor is a piece of machinery with moving and rotating parts, the same precautions should be observed as with any piece of machinery of this type where carelessness in operation or maintenance is hazardous to personnel. In addition to the many obvious safety rules that should be followed with this type of machinery, the additional safety precautions as listed below must be observed:

1. Read all instructions completely before operating air compressor or unit.
2. For installation, follow all local electrical and safety codes, as well as the National Electrical Code (NEC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA).
3. Electric motors must be securely and adequately grounded. This can be accomplished by wiring with a grounded, metal-clad raceway system to the starter; by using a separate ground wire connected to the bare metal of the motor frame; or other suitable means.
4. Protect the power cable from coming in contact with sharp objects. Do not kink power cable and never allow the cable to come in contact with oil, grease, hot surfaces, or chemicals.
5. Make certain that the power source conforms to the requirements of your equipment.
6. Pull main electrical disconnect switch and disconnect any separate control lines, if used, before attempting to work or perform maintenance on the air compressor or unit. "Lock out" or "Tag out" all power sources.
7. Do not attempt to remove any compressor parts without first relieving the entire system of pressure.
8. Do not attempt to service any part while machine is in an operational mode.
9. Do not operate the compressor at pressures in excess of its rating.
10. Do not operate compressor at speeds in excess of its rating.
11. Periodically check all safety devices for proper operation. Do not change pressure setting or restrict operation in any way.
12. Be sure no tools, rags, or loose parts are left on the compressor or drive parts.
13. Do not use flammable solvents for cleaning the air inlet filter or element and other parts.
14. Exercise cleanliness during maintenance and when making repairs. Keep dirt away from parts by covering parts and exposed openings with clean cloth or Kraft paper.
15. Do not operate the compressor without guards, shields, and screens in place.
16. Do not install a shut-off valve in the discharge line, unless a pressure relief valve, of proper design and size, is installed in the line between the compressor unit and shut-off valve.
17. Do not operate compressor in areas where there is a possibility of ingesting flammable or toxic fumes.
18. Be careful when touching the exterior of a recently run motor - it may be hot enough to be painful or cause injury. With modern motors this condition is normal if operated at rated load - modern motors are built to operate at higher temperatures.
19. Inspect unit daily to observe and correct any unsafe operating conditions found.
20. Do not "play around" with compressed air, nor direct air stream at body, because this can cause injuries.
21. Compressed air from this machine absolutely must not be used for food processing or breathing air without adequate downstream filters, purifiers, and controls.
22. Always use an air pressure regulating device at the point of use, and do not use air pressure greater than marked maximum pressure of attachment.
23. Check hoses for weak or worn condition before each use and make certain that all connections are secure.
24. Always wear safety glasses when using compressed air gun.

The user of any air compressor package manufactured by **Champion – A Gardner Denver Co.**, is hereby warned that failure to follow the preceding Safety and Operation Precautions can result in injuries or equipment damage. However, **Champion – A Gardner Denver Co.**, does not state as fact or does not mean to imply that the preceding list of Safety and Operating Precautions is all-inclusive, and further that the observance of this list will prevent all injuries or equipment damage.

# INSTALLATION

> ![WARNING](https://via.placeholder.com/20/FFA500/000000?text=!) **WARNING**  
> Do not operate unit if damaged during shipping, handling or use. Operating unit if damaged may result in injury.

1. Permanently installed compressors must be located in a clean, well-ventilated dry room so the compressor receives an adequate supply of fresh, clean, cool, and dry air. It is recommended that a compressor used for painting be located in a separate room from the area where body sanding and painting are done. Abrasive particles or paint found to have clogged the air intake filters and intake valves shall automatically void the warranty.

2. Compressors should never be located so close to a wall or other obstruction that the flow of air through the fan-bladed flywheel, which cools the compressor, is impeded. Permanently mounted units should have the flywheel at least 12" from the wall.

3. Place the stationary compressor on firm, level ground or flooring. Permanent installations require bolting to the floor. Bolt holes in the tank or base feet are provided. Before bolting or lagging down, shim the compressor level. Avoid putting stress on a tank foot by pulling it down to the floor. This will only result in abnormal vibration and possible cracking of the Air Receiver.

   The vibro-isolator pads that came with the unit will need to be installed on the unit. Tanks bolted directly to a concrete floor without padding will not be warranted against cracking. Champion vibro-isolators must be used for the extended warranty to apply to ASME air receivers.

> ![DANGER](https://via.placeholder.com/20/FF0000/FFFFFF?text=!) **DANGER**  
> Do not install isolating valves between the compressor outlet and air receiver. This will cause excessive pressure if the valve is closed and cause injury and equipment damage.

> ![WARNING](https://via.placeholder.com/20/FFA500/000000?text=!) **WARNING**  
> Always use an air pressure regulating device at the point of use. Failure to do so can result in injury or equipment damage.

> ![CAUTION](https://via.placeholder.com/20/FFFF00/000000?text=!) **CAUTION**  
> - Do not install in an area where the ambient temperature is below 32 degrees F or above 100 degrees F.  
> - Do not install the unit in an area where air is dirty and/or chemical-laden.  
> - Unit is not to be installed outdoors.

# INSTALLATION (CONT’D)

## AIR LINE PIPING

Connection to air system should be of the same size, or larger, than discharge pipe out of unit. The table gives recommended minimum pipe sizes. A union connection to the unit and water drop leg is recommended. Install a flexible connector between the discharge of the unit and the plant air piping. Plant air piping should be periodically inspected for leaks using a soap and water solution for detection on all pipe joints. Air leaks waste energy and are expensive.

# INSTALLATION (CONT’D)

> ⚠️ **CAUTION**  
> Wiring must be such that when viewing compressor from opposite shaft end, rotation of shaft is clockwise as shown by arrow on guard. Wrong direction rotation for any length of time will result in damage to compressor.

## GROUNDING INSTRUCTIONS
This product should be connected to a grounded, metallic, permanent wiring system, or an equipment-grounding terminal or lead on the product.

## OPERATION
This compressor has been inspected, thoroughly tested and approved at the factory. For this unit to give long satisfactory service it must be installed and operated properly. This compressor has been designed for a **80%/ON – 20%/OFF** duty cycle.

Duplex units have lead and lag pressure switches and an automatic alternating system to evenly distribute the load between the two compressors. The pressure switches sense changes in receiver pressure and automatically start and stop the compressor at preset pressure levels. If the receiver pressure falls below the cut-in pressure setting of the lead pressure switch but remains above the cut-in pressure setting of the lag pressure switch, only one compressor will run until receiver pressure reaches the cut-out pressure of the lead pressure switch. The next time the pressure in the receiver drops, the system automatically starts the compressor that was idle. If the receiver pressure falls below the cut-in pressure setting of the lag pressure switch, both compressors run until receiver pressure reaches the cut-out pressure setting of the lead pressure switch.

To manually set lead compressor, set **Auto-Comp1-Comp2** switch to **Comp1** or **Comp2** for corresponding compressor to be lead.

To disable power to a compressor set its corresponding disconnect switch to **off**, set its corresponding **TOA** switch to **off** and set the **Auto-Comp1-Comp2** to the opposite compressor.

### Initial Start Up
1. Inspect unit for any visible signs of damage that would have occurred in shipment or during installation.
2. Pull main disconnect switch to unit to assure that no power is coming into the unit. “Lock Out” or “Tag Out” switch. Verify voltage corresponds to unit specifications.

> ⚠️ **WARNING**  
> Do not attempt to operate compressor on voltage other than that specified on order or on compressor motor.

3. Check compressor oil level. Add oil as required. See “Compressor Oil Specifications” Section.  
   **NOTE:** Do not mix oil type, weights or brands.
4. Activate main disconnect switch.
5. “Jog” motor and check for proper rotation by direction arrow. If rotation is wrong, reverse input connections on the magnetic starter.
6. Close discharge valve and start.
7. With discharge valve closed, let machine pump up to operating pressure. At this stage the automatic controls will take over. Check for proper cycling operation.
8. Check for proper operation of any options. Refer to individual option instruction sheet.
9. When the initial run period has shown no operating problems, shut unit down and recheck oil level.
10. Open discharge valve. The air compressor unit is now ready for use.

> ⚠️ **WARNING**  
> This unit can start automatically without warning.

# OPERATION CONT’D

## OIL MONITOR

### OIL MONITOR

The oil monitor must be used in conjunction with the control panel (see wiring diagram page 9 for details). The oil monitor is installed on the outside of the air compressor crankcase with a port that allows oil to feed into its float bowl chamber and maintain the same level as in the crankcase. The float moves vertically up or down as the oil level changes. If the oil level is below the minimum allowable operating level, the reed switch will open, thus stopping the motor. A magnet holds the float and prevents the compressor from starting.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The Oil Monitor does not eliminate the compressor owner's responsibility for periodically checking oil level.

# GUIDE TO MAINTENANCE

To obtain reliable and satisfactory service, this unit requires a consistent preventive maintenance schedule. Maintenance schedule pages are included in the back of this manual to aid in keeping the proper records.

> ⚠️ **WARNING**  
> Before performing any maintenance function, switch main disconnect switch to "off" position to assure no power is entering unit. "Lock Out" or "Tag Out" all sources of power. Be sure all air pressure in unit is relieved. Failure to do this may result in injury or equipment damage.

## DAILY MAINTENANCE

1. Check oil level of both compressor and engine if so equipped. Add quality lubricating oil as required. See Section on "Oil Specifications".
2. Drain moisture from tank by opening tank drain valve located in bottom of tank. Do not open drain valve if tank pressure exceeds 25 PSIG.
3. Check operation of electric tank drain by pushing manual test button located on drain.
4. Turn off compressor at the end of each day's operation. Turn off power supply at wall switch.

## WEEKLY MAINTENANCE

1. Clean dust and foreign matter from cylinder head, motor, fan blade, air lines, intercooler, and tank.
2. Remove and clean intake air filters.

> ⚠️ **WARNING**  
> Do not exceed 15 PSIG nozzle pressure when cleaning element parts with compressed air. Do not direct compressed air against human skin. Serious injury could result. Never wash elements in fuel oil, gasoline, or flammable solvent.

3. Check V-belts for tightness. The V-belts must be tight enough to transmit the necessary power to the compressor. Adjust the V-belts as follows:
   - a. Remove bolts and guard to access compressor drive.
   - b. Loosen mounting hardware which secures motor to base. Slide motor within slots of baseplate to desired position.
   - c. Apply pressure with finger to one belt at midpoint span. Tension is correct if top of belt aligns with bottom of adjacent belt. Make further adjustments if necessary.
   - d. Check the alignment of pulleys. Adjust if necessary.
   - e. Tighten mounting hardware to secure motor on base.
   - f. Re-install guard and secure with bolts.

## GENERAL MAINTENANCE NOTES

### PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE
The pressure relief valve is an automatic pop valve. Each valve is properly adjusted for the maximum pressure permitted by tank specifications and working pressure of the unit on which it is installed. If it should pop, it will be necessary to drain all the air out of the tank in order to reseat properly. **Do not readjust.**

### MANUAL TANK DRAIN VALVE
Drain valve is located at bottom of tank. Open drain valve daily to drain condensation. **Do not open drain valve if tank pressure exceeds 25 PSIG.** The automatic tank drain equipped compressor requires draining manually once a week.

### PRESSURE SWITCH
The pressure switch is automatic and will start compressor at low pressure and stop when the maximum pressure is reached. It is adjusted to start and stop compressor at the proper pressure for the unit on which it is installed. **Do not readjust.**

### BELTS
Drive belts must be kept tight enough to prevent slipping. If belts slip or squeak, see V-belt maintenance in preceding section.

> ⚠ **CAUTION**  
> If belts are too tight, overload will be put on motor and motor bearings.

### COMPRESSOR VALVES
If compressor fails to pump air or seems slow in filling up tank, disconnect unit from power source and remove valves and clean thoroughly, using compressed air and a soft wire brush. After cleaning, exceptional care must be taken that all parts are replaced in exactly the same position and all joints must be tight or the compressor will not function properly. When all valves are replaced and connections tight, close hand valve at tank outlet for final test. **Valve gaskets should be replaced each time valves are removed from pump.**

# GENERAL MAINTENANCE (Cont'd.)

## CENTRIFUGAL UNLOADER AND UNLOADER PRESSURE RELEASE VALVE:

The centrifugal unloader is operated by two governor weights. It is totally enclosed and lubricated from the crankcase of the compressor. When the compressor starts, the governor weights automatically open, compressing the main spring, allowing the unloader pressure release valve to close. When the compressor stops, the main spring returns the governor weights to normal position, opening the unloader pressure release valve and unloading the compressor. This prevents overloading the motor when starting. 

If air continues to escape through the governor or unloader pressure release valve while operating, this is an indication that the unloader pressure release valve is not closing tightly and may be held open by a foreign substance lodged on the seat. To correct this, remove the governor release valve cap, giving access to the unloader pressure release valve spring and ball. Clean thoroughly and return parts in the same order in which they were removed. 

Loose drive belts can also cause the unloader to leak by preventing the compressor from reaching proper speed. (See **"BELTS"** above).

## CHECK VALVE:

The check valve closes when the compressor stops operating, preventing air from flowing out of the tank through the pressure release valve. After the compressor stops operating, if air continues to escape through the release valve, it is an indication that the check valve is leaking. This can be corrected by removing the check valve and cleaning the disc and seat. If the check valve is worn badly, replace it.

> **⚠ WARNING**  
> Before removing the check valve, be sure all air is drained out of the tank and power is disconnected.  
> Failure to do so may result in injury or equipment damage.

## THE INTERSTAGE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE:

The interstage pressure relief valve is provided to protect against interstage overpressure and is factory set for a maximum pressure of **75 PSIG**. **DO NOT RESET**.

If the pressure relief valve pops, it indicates trouble. Shut down the unit immediately and determine and correct the malfunction. Inspect the head valves. Serious damage can result if not corrected and can lead to complete destruction of the unit. Tampering with the interstage pressure relief valve, or plugging the opening, destroys the protection provided and voids all warranty.

## COMPRESSOR LUBRICATION:

Fill the crankcase to the proper level as indicated by the oil sight gauge. Keep the crankcase filled as required by usage. It is recommended that only **Champlub recip lubricant** be used. This is a **30-weight, non-detergent industrial oil** with rust and oxidation inhibitors, specially formulated for reciprocating compressors. **Do not mix oil types, weights, or brands.**

## MOTOR LUBRICATION:

Long-term satisfactory operation of an electric motor depends largely on proper lubrication of the bearings. Bearing grease will lose its lubricating ability over time, not suddenly. Refer to the motor manufacturer’s instructions for the type of grease and lubrication intervals.

This is an ISO 100 non-detergent industrial lubricant with rust and oxidation inhibitors specially formulated for reciprocating compressors. It is recommended this compressor be maintained using this oil for ambient temperatures above 32°F.

CHAMPLUB synthetic is a premium grade diester-based synthetic lubricant providing excellent performance in high-temperature applications.

> ⚠️ **CAUTION**  
> Do not mix oil types, weights or brands.

> ⚠️ **CAUTION**  
> **"Emulsification of oil (white milky substance) indicates unsafe accumulation of moisture and may be evidence compressor is oversized for application. Failure to promptly consult your local distributor, or Champion Customer Service, can be grounds to deny warranty."**

## NOTES:
1. Normal break-in period of Champion air compressors is 25 hours.
2. For the first 100 hours of compressor operation, a careful and regular check of the oil level should be made. Maintain oil level at the full line.

## CHANGING TO SYNTHETIC LUBRICANT
*(Applies to diester-based synthetic lubricant only)*  
If changing to synthetic lubricant, the following steps must be completed:

1. Compressor must run for a 25-hour break-in period using ChampLub ISO 100 oil.
2. Thoroughly drain existing oil from crankcase.
3. Fill crankcase with a full charge of synthetic lubricant.
4. Run compressor for 200 hours.
5. Stop compressor and thoroughly drain the synthetic lubricant.
6. Add a full charge of synthetic lubricant.
7. Compressor is now ready to run for an extended period before the next lubricant change. Maintain oil level at the full line.

# RECEIVER DRAIN TIMER

## OPERATION

The Drain Timer is designed for trouble-free draining of unwanted accumulations of condensate. The timer module initiates a drain cycle by energizing the valve coil that opens the valve and allows the condensate to drain. At the end of the cycle, the coil is de-energized and the valve is spring-returned to the closed position. At the beginning of the drain cycle, the ON light illuminates and the OFF light turns off. The lights switch at the end of a timer cycle.

1. When power is applied to the timer, the timer will immediately put power to the valve for the amount of time indicated by the setting of the ON TIME. Removing and reapplying power will again actuate the timing cycle.
2. Pushing the test button located on the front panel will actuate the valve for as long as the button is depressed.
3. Once the timer is plugged in, the timing cycle will begin. The valve will be actuated at the interval of time that is indicated by the setting of the knob for the OFF TIME.

## TESTING THE DRAIN TIMER

> ⚠️ **CAUTION**  
> **COMPRESSED AIR CAN BE DANGEROUS.** Be sure the pressure vessel is depressurized prior to any attempt to install or remove the Drain Timer. **DO NOT REMOVE** the power cord or timer from the valve while the Drain Timer is plugged in. If the drain does not seem to be working properly, contact your distributor. Any attempt to repair the drain without authorization will **VOID WARRANTY**.

1. Fully drain the vessel by opening an auxiliary gate valve or push the test button on the timer. When all of the condensate has drained, set the OFF TIME to the maximum 45-minute setting and the ON TIME to the maximum 10 seconds.
2. Remove the valve guard strainer and inspect for debris and damage. Clean or replace as necessary.
3. Return prior to the time the drain is expected to open and check to see how long it takes for the valve to exhaust the liquid. If at the end of the drain open period, all the liquid has not been expelled, adjust the OFF TIME downward and repeat steps 1 & 2.
4. Set the ON TIME equal to the amount of time it takes to drain the vessel. We suggest increasing the time by 20% to compensate for small fluctuations in air system usage or climatic changes. The drain should be checked periodically to ensure a proper setting was achieved. In climates with large changes in humidity, the drain should be checked and reset accordingly.
