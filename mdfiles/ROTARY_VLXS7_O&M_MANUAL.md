# SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS

- **Daily** inspect your lift. Never operate if it malfunctions or if it has broken or damaged parts. Use **only** qualified lift service personnel and genuine Rotary parts to make repairs.
- **Thoroughly** train all employees in use and care of lift, using manufacturer’s instructions and “Lifting It Right” and “Safety Tips” supplied with the lift.
- **Never** allow unauthorized or untrained persons to position vehicle or operate lift.
- **Prohibit** unauthorized persons from being in shop area while lift is in use.
- **Do Not** permit anyone on lift or inside vehicle when it is either being raised or lowered.
- **Always** keep area around lift free of tools, debris, grease and oil.
- **Never** overload lift. Capacity of VLXS10 lift is 10,000 lbs., 2500 lbs. per pad. Capacity of VLXS7 lift is 7000 lbs., 1750 lbs. per pad.
- **Do Not** stand in front of the lift or vehicle while it is being positioned in lift bay.
- Before driving vehicle into lift bay, **BE SURE** lift is fully lowered.
- **Load** vehicle on lift carefully. Position lift to contact at the vehicle manufacturer's recommended lift points. Raise lift until there is contact with the vehicle. Check lift for secure contact with vehicle. Raise lift to desired working height.

> ⚠️ **CAUTION** Do Not go under vehicle if locking latches are not engaged.

- **Do Not** block open or override self-closing lift controls; they are designed to return to the “Off” or Neutral position when released.
- **Remain clear** of lift when raising or lowering vehicle.
- **Always** lower lift completely and disconnect power source before disconnecting hydraulic lines.
- **Avoid** excessive rocking of vehicle while on lift.
- **Clear** area if vehicle is in danger of falling.
- **Completely** lower lift before removing vehicle from lift area.
- **Release** locking latches before attempting to lower lift.

> ℹ️ **IMPORTANT** The locking leg latch will reset automatically **ONLY** when the lift is fully lowered. If during the lowering process the lift is stopped before it gets to the fully lowered position, the locking leg **MUST** be reset by manually rotating the latch release handle.

- **B.** Certain vehicles such as Camaro, Firebird, Escort, or Chrysler "K" Cars or others may require additional clearance under the carriage or exhaust system from contacting pad support. Use auxiliary adapters. Locate at the vehicle manufacturer's recommended pick-up points.

> **Note:** Allow (2) seconds between motor starts. Failure to comply may cause motor burnout.

## 4. To Raise Lift:
1. Push **Raise Switch (A)** on the power unit (See Fig. 2).
2. Stop before making contact with the vehicle. Be sure wheels and/or mud flaps clear pad end ramps.
3. Raise the vehicle until tires clear the floor.
4. Stop and check pads for secure contact at the vehicle manufacturer’s recommended lift points.
5. Continue to raise to the desired height **only if** the vehicle is secure on the lift.
6. Repeat complete spotting, loading, and raising procedures if required.
7. Actuate **Lowering Handle (B)** (See Fig. 2) to lower the lift onto locking latches.

> ⚠ **CAUTION:** **DO NOT** go under the vehicle if locking latches are not engaged.

## 5. While Using Lift:
- **A.** Avoid excessive rocking of the vehicle while on the lift.

## 6. To Lower Lift:
1. Remove all tools, bystanders, and other objects from the lift area.
2. Raise the lift off locking latches.
3. Rotate **Latch Release Handle** (See Fig. 3).
4. Push **Lowering Valve Handle (B)** to lower the lift (See Fig. 2).

> **Note:** The Lowering Valve Handles are deadman-type design. Each must be held down to lower the lift.

> ⚠ **CAUTION:** **DO NOT** override self-closing lift controls.

## 7. Remain clear of the lift when lowering the vehicle.

## 8. Remove adapters from under the vehicle. Be sure the lift is fully lowered before removing the vehicle.

## 9. If the lift is not operating properly, **Do Not** use it until adjustment or repairs are made by qualified lift service personnel.

# LIFT LOCKOUT/TAGOUT PROCEDURE

## Purpose
This procedure establishes the minimum requirements for the lockout of energy that could cause injury to personnel by the operation of lifts in need of repair or being serviced. All employees shall comply with this procedure.

## Responsibility
The responsibility for assuring that this procedure is followed is binding upon all employees and service personnel from outside service companies (i.e., Authorized Rotary Installers, contactors, etc.). All employees shall be instructed in the safety significance of the lockout procedure by the facility owner/manager. Each new or transferred employee along with visiting outside service personnel shall be instructed by the owner/manager (or assigned designee) in the purpose and use of the lockout procedure.

## Preparation
Employees authorized to perform lockout shall ensure that the appropriate energy isolating device (i.e., circuit breaker, fuse, disconnect, etc.) is identified for the lift being locked out. Other such devices for other equipment may be located in close proximity of the appropriate energy isolating device. If the identity of the device is in question, see the shop supervisor for resolution. Assure that proper authorization is received prior to performing the lockout procedure.

## Sequence of Lockout Procedure
1. Notify all affected employees that a lockout is being performed and the reason for it.
2. Unload the subject lift. Shut it down and assure the disconnect switch is “OFF” if one is provided on the lift.
3. The authorized lockout person operates the main energy isolation device removing power to the subject lift.
   - If this is a lockable device, the authorized lockout person places the assigned padlock on the device to prevent its unintentional reactivation. An appropriate tag is applied stating the person’s name, at least 3” x 6” in size, an easily noticeable color, and states not to operate device or remove tag.
   - If this device is a non-lockable circuit breaker or fuse, replace with a “dummy” device and tag it appropriately as mentioned above.
4. Attempt to operate lift to assure the lockout is working. Be sure to return any switches to the “OFF” position.
5. The equipment is now locked out and ready for the required maintenance or service.

## Restoring Equipment to Service
1. Assure the work on the lift is complete and the area is clear of tools, vehicles, and personnel.
2. At this point, the authorized person can remove the lock (or dummy circuit breaker or fuse) & tag and activate the energy isolating device so that the lift may again be placed into operation.

## Rules for Using Lockout Procedure
Use the Lockout Procedure whenever the lift is being repaired or serviced, waiting for repair when current operation could cause possible injury to personnel, or for any other situation when unintentional operation could injure personnel. No attempt shall be made to operate the lift when the energy isolating device is locked out.
