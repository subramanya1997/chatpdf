## Operator Protective Equipment

⚠️ **Operator Protective Equipment**  
Personal protective equipment helps make tire changing safer. However, equipment does not take the place of safe operating practices. Always wear durable work clothing during tire service activity. Shop aprons or shop coats may also be worn, however loose-fitting clothing should be avoided.  

Tight-fitting leather gloves are recommended to protect the operator’s hands when handling worn tires and wheels. Sturdy leather work shoes with steel toes and oil-resistant soles should be used by tire service personnel to help prevent injury in typical shop activities.  

Eye protection is essential during tire service activity. Safety glasses with side shields, goggles, or face shields are acceptable. Back belts provide support during lifting activities and are also helpful in providing operator protection. Consideration should also be given to the use of hearing protection if tire service activity is performed in an enclosed area, or if noise levels are high.

# OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

The unit must be properly operated and properly maintained to help avoid accidents that could damage the unit and injure the operator or bystanders. This section of the Operating Instructions manual reviews basic operations and use of controls. These instructions should be reviewed with all employees before they are allowed to work with the machine. Keep these instructions near the machine for easy reference.

## BEAD LOOSENING AND DEMOUNTING

> **CAUTION**  
> This machine may operate differently from machines you have previously operated. Practice with a regular steel wheel and tire combination to familiarize yourself with the machine’s operation and function.

### A. General Precautions

- Remember to remove all weights from both sides of the wheel. Weights left on the back side of the wheel may cause the wheel to be clamped unlevel. This may result in the combination mount/demount head contacting the rim, causing scratches. On alloy wheels, always rotate the wheel one turn after setting the head to ensure proper wheel chucking.
- Always review nicks and scratches with owners of expensive wheel and tire combinations prior to servicing.
- Review the performance wheel section of this manual prior to servicing performance tire/wheel combinations.

### 1. Deflate the Tire

Deflate the tire completely by removing the valve core from the valve stem (Figure 1).

![Figure 1 – Remove Valve Core to Deflate Tire](image1.jpg)

> **NOTE:** Loosening the beads on a partially or fully inflated tire is unsafe and causes excess movement and friction against the bumper pads and excessive wear on pivots. Deflate the tire completely to prolong the life of your machine.

### D. Bead Loosening Steps

- Always loosen the bead on the narrow side of the wheel’s drop center first. See Figure 4 for more information on the drop center.
- The clamps on the table top may extend beyond the table top itself. To avoid damaging the clamps, move them to their full inward position before positioning a tire for bead loosening.
- Use extra care in positioning the bead loosener shoe on larger wheels/tires, and on alloy wheels. Make sure the shoe rests next to but not on the rim, and not on the tire sidewall.

### 2. Position the Bead Loosener Shoe

- Pull the bead loosener shoe away from the machine and roll the wheel into position. The valve stem should be in the 3 o’clock position.
- Position the bead loosener shoe against the tire next to, but not on, the rim.
- Press the button on the bead loosener to actuate the shoe and loosen the bead. It may be necessary to loosen the bead in multiple locations around the tire (Figure 2).

![Figure 2 – Position Tire and Bead Loosener Shoe](image2.jpg)

### 3. Repeat the Loosening Procedure

- Turn the wheel around and repeat the loosening procedure on the other side of the wheel. This should be the long side of the drop center (see Figure 4).

> **G.** It will be easier to clamp the wheel to the table top if the lower bead is loosened last.

### 4. Apply Rubber Lubricant

- Apply the tire manufacturer’s approved rubber lubricant liberally to the entire circumference of both tire beads after loosening (Figure 3).

![Figure 3 – Apply Rubber Lubricant to Tire Beads](image3.jpg)

## Instructions for Mounting a Tire Using the COATS 5060A/E/AX/EX Rim Clamp Tire Changer

### 5. Determine the Mounting Side of the Wheel
The mounting side is the narrow side of the drop center. *(Tire removed in Figure 4 for clarity.)*

![Figure 4 – Determining Mounting Side of Wheel](#)

### 6. Place Tire/Wheel Assembly on Table Top
- Position the tire/wheel assembly on the table with the mounting side up *(Figure 5)*.
- Use the clamp control pedal to move the clamps:
  - **Inwards** (push pedal down)
  - **Outwards** (toggle pedal up)
- **Clamping Instructions:**
  - **Steel wheels:** Clamp from the inside (clamps push outwards against the wheel).
  - **Mag and custom wheels:** Clamp from the outside (clamps push inwards against the outside rim edge).
- Refer to the *Performance Tires and Wheels* section.

![Figure 5 – Place Tire/Wheel Assembly on Table Top](#)

### 7. Move the Swing Arm into Position
- Pull the locking handle forward to release the slide.
- Push down on the top of the vertical slide to move the demount head into contact with the rim edge.
- Push the locking handle back to lock the slide into place.
- As the slide locks, the mount/demount head will move upward approximately **1/8 inch** from the rim edge *(Figure 6)*.

![Figure 6 - Position Mount/Demount Tool](#)

### 8. Adjust the Swing Arm to Position the Head Roller
- The mount/demount head roller should be in contact with the rim edge.
- Turn the swing arm adjusting knob to move the roller **1/8 to 1/4 inch** away from the rim *(Figure 7)*.

![Figure 7 - Adjust Swing Arm to Position Head Roller](#)

### 9. Check Head Positioning
- The mount/demount head should be positioned with:
  - **1/8 to 3/16 inch** clearance between the top of the rim edge and the bottom of the head.
  - **1/8 to 1/4 inch** clearance between the rim edge and the head roller.
- This clearance will be maintained as long as the locking handle and adjustment knob are not changed.
- The operator may swing the arm out of the way and back into place again without needing to reposition the head *(when changing a like set of wheels)* *(Figure 8)*.

![Figure 8 - Proper Mount/Demount Head Position](#)

### **Important Note:**
The vertical tool clearance may change with machine use and should be inspected often. **Failure to maintain the proper clearance may result in damage to the wheel rim and/or tire.**

### 10. Insert the Bead Lifting Tool
- Insert the smooth curved end of the bead lifting tool over the forward end of the demount head and below the top bead of the tire.
- Use your free hand to press down on the tire opposite the head to help with tool insertion *(Figure 9)*.

# Demounting Procedure

## Figure 9 - Insert Bead Lifting Tool

11. Push the bead lifting tool down towards the wheel to lift the tire bead up and over the knob portion of the demount head. Hold the tool and bead in this position (Figure 10).

## Figure 10 - Lift Bead Over Demount Head

12. Depress the table top pedal to rotate the wheel clockwise. The demount head will guide the upper bead up and over the edge of the wheel.

**J.** Push down on the tire across from the demount head during table top rotation to utilize the drop center area of the wheel. This reduces the tensional force on the top or first bead during demount (Figure 9).

13. Lift and hold the tire at an angle so that the lower bead is resting in the drop center directly across from the demount head, and is loose below the demount head (Figure 11). Insert the smooth curved end of the bead lifting tool down over the forward end of the mount/demount tool and below the lower bead. Lift the bead up and over the knob on the demount head (Figure 12).

## Figure 11 - Demounting Lower Bead

14. Depress the table top pedal to rotate the wheel. The demount head will guide the bead up and over the edge of the wheel. Continue rotation until lower bead is demounted.

## Figure 12 - Guide Lower Bead Over Tool Head

**K.** With tube-type tires, demount the upper bead and remove the tube before demounting the lower bead.

**L.** Table top rotation can be stopped at any time by removing your foot from the rotation pedal.

**M.** Normal table top rotation for demounting is clockwise. Depress the table top pedal to rotate this direction. To rotate the table top counterclockwise, lift the pedal up with your toe.

> **CAUTION**  
> At times during the mounting and demounting procedure, the bead lifting tool may encounter resistance or come under load. Keep one hand firmly on the tool to avoid possible tool disconnect. Use the reversing feature to back out of jam ups.

✔ **After successfully completing the demount process, proceed to Mounting (page 6).**

# MOUNTING

This information must be read and followed carefully to prevent accidents and injuries during mounting.

> **⚠ WARNING**  
> Check tire and wheel carefully before mounting. Make sure the tire bead diameter and wheel diameter match exactly. Consult the Rubber Manufacturer's Association for approved rim widths for tire sizes.

> **⛔ DANGER**  
> Attempts to force a bead seat on mis-matched tires and wheels can cause the tire to violently explode, causing serious personal injury or death to operator and/or bystanders.

> **⚠ CAUTION**  
> Never mount a tire and wheel handed to you by anyone without checking both tire and wheel for damage and compatibility. Be extra cautious of persons without knowledge of tire service. Keep bystanders out of service area.

> **⚠ WARNING**  
> Never mount a damaged tire. Never mount a tire on a rusty or damaged wheel. Damaged tires and/or wheels may explode.

> **⚠ CAUTION**  
> If you damage the tire bead during mounting, **STOP!**, remove the tire and mark it as damaged. Do not mount a damaged tire.

### Mounting Steps

1. **Inspect the wheel** closely for damage. Clean the wheel and remove any light corrosion or rubber residue (Figure 13). Do not attempt to service heavily corroded wheels.  
   ![Figure 13 - Inspect and Clean the Wheel](Figure13.jpg)

2. **Inspect the tire** for damage, paying close attention to the beads. Verify size match between tire and wheel (Figure 13).

3. **Lubricate tire beads** liberally with tire manufacturer-approved lubricant (Figure 14).  
   ![Figure 14 - Lubricate Beads](Figure14.jpg)

4. **Place tire over wheel** and move swing arm into position. Position tire so that the lower bead is above the rear extension of the mount/demount head and below the front knob (Figure 15).  
   ![Figure 15 - Position Tire Against Mount/Demount Head](Figure15.jpg)

5. **Depress table top pedal** and rotate the wheel to mount the lower bead. Use the drop center of the wheel to reduce the tensional force on the bead by pressing down on the tire directly across from the mount head. Rotate table top until lower bead is fully mounted.

6. **For top bead**, rotate the table top until the valve stem is directly across from the mount head. Lift the upper bead up and over the rear of the mount head. With your left hand press down on the tire between the mount head and the valve stem to hold the tire in the drop center. Depress table top pedal and rotate tire until the bead is mounted. Continue to press down on tire during the remaining mounting process (Figure 16).  
   ![Figure 16 - Mounting Top Bead](Figure16.jpg)

> **⚠ WARNING**  
> Do not force the tire onto the rim. Bead damage could result making the tire unsafe and/or creating the risk of injury.

### Additional Notes

- **N.** If table top rotation stalls, reverse the table top momentarily until the tire bead is again loose on the wheel. Reposition the tire on the mount head, make sure the bead is correctly positioned in the drop center of the wheel, then attempt mounting again.
- **P.** For low profile or stiff sidewall tires, it may be advantageous to use the bead lifting tool to initially hold the upper bead down in the drop center, or use drop center tools as shown in Figure 32, page 11.
- **R.** For tube type tires, mount the lower bead first, move swing arm out, install the tube, and then mount the upper bead.

# INFLATION

Tire inflation is performed in three steps: **Bead Seal, Bead Seat, and Inflation**. These steps are explained in detail on page 13. Read the explanation of each step and understand them thoroughly before proceeding.

> ⚠️ **CAUTION**  
> Check for proper inflation gauge operation. Accurate pressure readings are important to safe tire inflation. Refer to the Operating Maintenance section of this manual for instructions.

> ⚠️ **CAUTION**  
> If the rim has been clamped from the outside for tire mounting, release the clamps, lift the tire, and move the clamps to the center of the table top.

> ⚠️ **CAUTION**  
> If the wheel/tire has a diameter larger than 14 inches and is difficult to bead seal, the clamps should be moved to the center of the table top for the bead seal operation.

> ⚠️ **DANGER**  
> Tire failure under pressure is hazardous. This tire changer is not intended to be a safety device to contain exploding tires, tubes, wheels, or bead sealing equipment. Inspect tire and wheel carefully for match, wear, or defects before mounting. Always use approved tire bead lubricant during mounting and inflation.

The inflation pedal, located at the rear of the left side of the machine, controls the flow of air through the inflation hose.

**NOTE:** The clip-on chuck on the end of the hose should always be an open style with all parts in proper working order.

## Inflation Pedal Positions

| **Position** | **Description** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Position 1 - Tire Pressure** | With the inflation hose attached to the tire valve and the pedal in this position, the air gauge will register the air pressure in the tire. Whenever your foot is removed from the pedal, it will return to this position. |
| **Position 2 - Tire Inflation** | This is the first activated position. With the inflation hose attached to the tire valve and the pedal in this position, line pressure is allowed to flow through the valve and into the tire for inflation. Tire pressure is not indicated on the gauge in this position. |
| **Position 3 - Bead Sealing** | This is the second and last activated position. With the inflation hose attached to the tire valve and the pedal in this position, line pressure is allowed to flow through the valve and to the air-flate bead seal jets on the table top for bead sealing. |

> ⚠️ **CAUTION**  
> Use **Position 3** for bead sealing only. Do not use this position without a tire and wheel positioned on the table top. Dirt and debris could be blown into the air with enough force to injure the operator or bystanders. Do not use this position to inflate a tire.

The unit is equipped with a **pressure limiter** to assist the operator with proper tire inflation. When the inflation pedal is held in **Position 2**, the pressure limiter cycles the machine between **Position 2 (inflation)** and **Position 1 (at rest, no air flow to tire)**. This cycling helps to prevent over-inflation of the tire. 

Tires can still be over-inflated and explode with the use of this pressure limiter if all of the instructions in this manual are not followed completely. The pressure limiter will keep most car and light truck tires from inflating beyond **60 PSI** (smaller tires may reach higher pressures). 

It is the operator's responsibility to follow all instructions and to control inflation pressure as specified in these instructions. Check the function of the pressure limiter regularly and maintain it according to the instructions provided in this manual for safe and proper operation. **Do not tamper with or attempt to adjust the pressure limiter.** Tires requiring inflation beyond **60 PSI** should be inflated in a safety cage.

## Bead Sealing

1. Position valve stem in front of operator and connect the inflation hose. Hold tire up against the upper edge of the wheel. Be sure tire’s top bead is over the bottom of the valve stem (Figure 17).

![Figure 17 - Lift Tire Upwards for Bead Sealing](image-placeholder)

## Bead Seating

> **⚠ WARNING**  
> Operator should keep hands, arms, and entire body away from the tire during the remaining bead seat and inflation procedures. Do not stand over tire, as personal injury could result.

> **⚠ WARNING**  
> NEVER increase air pressure to exceed 40 PSI when attempting Bead Seat. If operator is unable to obtain Bead Seat, something is wrong. Deflate tire completely, inspect tire and wheel, correct any problems found, relubricate both tire beads, and reattempt Bead Seal and Seat procedures. Follow all safety instructions in this manual and on machine.

1. Once tire pressure is indicated on the air gauge (inflation pedal in position 1; foot removed from pedal), continue to inject air into the tire in short intervals. Check the pressure frequently. Stand back during bead seat. Keep hands, arms, and entire body away from tire during this procedure.

   Tire beads should move outward and "pop" into their bead seat position as pressure inside the tire increases. If this does not happen, a problem exists. Investigate carefully.

> **⚠ DANGER**  
> Check tire pressure frequently. Never exceed 40 PSI while seating beads. Once seated, never exceed tire manufacturer's recommended air pressure. Tires can **explode**, especially if they are inflated beyond their limits. At all pressure levels when inflating through the valve stem, keep hands, arms, and entire body away from inflating tire. An exploding tire, wheel, or bead sealing equipment may propel upward and outward with sufficient force to cause serious injury or death to operator or bystander.

## Inflation

> **⚠ DANGER**  
> NEVER exceed tire manufacturer's recommended air pressure. Tires can **explode**, especially if inflated beyond these limits. Keep hands, arms, and entire body back from inflating tire. Avoid distraction during inflation. Check tire pressure frequently to avoid over inflation. Excessive pressure can cause tires to explode, causing serious injury or death to operator or bystander.

1. Make sure both beads are seated. When both beads are seated, the tire is ready for inflation.
2. Replace the valve core if it was removed.
3. Depress the inflation pedal to position 2 to inflate the tire. The pressure limiter will cycle the air flow as described earlier. On most passenger car tires, the pressure limiter will cease air flow at approximately 60 PSI. On smaller volume tires the pressure may be higher.
4. Release air pressure from tire by pressing the manual release valve button (inflation hose must be attached to the valve stem, Figure 18).

> **⚠ DANGER**  
> **Explosion Hazard**  
> Never exceed 40 PSI while seating beads.

> **⚠ DANGER**  
> **Explosion Hazard**  
> Never inflate tire above manufacturer's recommended pressure after bead is seated.

# PERFORMANCE, CUSTOM, AND ALUMINUM WHEELS

> **CAUTION**  
> Only tire technicians with experience and training on custom wheels should attempt to service expensive custom alloy or aluminum wheels and high-performance low-profile tires.

## Pre-Operation Notes:
- Ensure all weights have been removed.
- Assistance will be required on wide wheels.
- Clamp wheel from the outside.
- Use ample lubricant for mount and demounting.
- Always review wheel nicks and/or scratches with the owner before servicing.

## Aluminum and Custom Wheels
Follow instructions provided for standard steel wheels, except:

### AA. Rotate Table Top
After loosening and lubricating both beads, rotate the table top until the clamps are in the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions.

![Figure 19 - Rotate Table Top to 12 O'clock](image-placeholder)

### AB. Clamp Positioning
The normal position for all clamps is **position 1** (or the most inward position). This provides:
- Outside clamping of wheels **10 to 17.5 inches** in diameter.
- Inside clamping of wheels **12 to 20 inches** in diameter.

Use **position 2** only on large diameter wheels. This provides:
- Outside clamping of wheels **14 to 21 inches**.
- Inside clamping of wheels **16 to 24 inches**.

![Figure 20 - Adjustable Clamp Positions](image-placeholder)

### AC. Clamping the Wheel
Clamp the wheel from the outside. Position the rim edge into the clamp at the **12 o'clock position**. Lower the wheel and depress the clamp control pedal. Slowly move the clamps inward until they securely contact the outside edge of the rim.

> **TIP:** This is usually accomplished by crouching down in front of the tire changer, holding the wheel with the right hand, and operating the clamp control pedal with the left hand. This allows the operator to watch the clamps as they move to ensure proper, damage-free clamping.

---

## Performance Tires and Wheels • Demounting
Follow these instructions for performance-type tires and wheels, including **run-flat tires** and their associated wheels, and **asymmetrical hump wheels**.

1. **Remove valve core and completely deflate tire.**
2. **Position for Bead Loosening:**
   - Pull the bead loosener shoe away from the machine and roll the tire into position against the bumper pads.
   - Position the tire with the valve stem in the **3 o'clock position** (in direct line with the bead loosener shoe).
   - Reposition the bead loosener positioning pin for wheels over **10 inches wide**.
   - Always loosen the bead on the **narrow/mounting side** of the wheel first.

## AD: Asymmetrical Hump Wheels

Wheels with an asymmetrical hump have a larger "ledge" type hump around the wheel except at the valve hole, making them more difficult to mount and demount (Figure 22).

![Figure 22 - Asymmetrical Hump Wheel](image-placeholder)

**Figure 22 - Asymmetrical Hump Wheel**

## AE: Wheels with Low Pressure Sensor/Transmitter

Some wheels have a low pressure sensor/transmitter strapped to the wheel. This is especially true on run-flat tire/wheel systems. The sensor is positioned directly opposite from the valve stem. To avoid damaging the sensor, always loosen the top bead at the valve stem first, then loosen the bottom bead at the valve stem, and then continue to loosen the remaining circumference of the beads as necessary (Figure 23).

![Figure 23 - Wheel with Low Pressure Sensor/Transmitter](image-placeholder)

**Figure 23 - Wheel with Low Pressure Sensor/Transmitter**

### Steps for Loosening and Lubricating Beads

1. **Loosen bottom bead**, starting with the valve stem positioned directly next to the loosener shoe (Figure 24).

   ![Figure 24 - Loosen Bottom Bead](image-placeholder)

   **Figure 24 - Loosen Bottom Bead**

2. **Liberally lubricate the bottom bead** of the tire (Figure 25).

   ![Figure 25 - Lubricate Bottom Bead](image-placeholder)

   **Figure 25 - Lubricate Bottom Bead**

3. **Clamp the wheel** to the table top as described in items AB and AC on page 9. Always clamp custom wheels from the outside.

4. **Lubricate upper bead liberally**. Use the bead lifting tool to help push the tire bead down so the bead area is easier to reach for lubrication (Figure 26).

   ![Figure 26 - Lubricate Upper Bead](image-placeholder)

   **Figure 26 - Lubricate Upper Bead**

5. **Move swing arm into place and adjust** as described on page 4, steps 7, 8, and 9. Increase the distance between the demount head and the wheel an additional 1/16 to 1/8 inch with the adjustment knob. Locate the valve stem directly under the demount head before proceeding (Figure 27).

   ![Figure 27 - Position Valve Stem Under Demount Head](image-placeholder)

   **Figure 27 - Position Valve Stem Under Demount Head**

6. **Insert bead lifting tool** between the knob on the demount tool and the tire bead. Pull the lifting tool down over the wheel to lift the bead up and over the knob (Figure 28).

## AF: Handling Asymmetrical Hump Wheels and Stiff Sidewall Performance Tires

On asymmetrical hump wheels and stiff sidewall performance tires, it may be necessary to use **two optional drop center tools (part #435685)** to hold the tire in the drop center so that the bead can be lifted over the demount tool.

[COATS 5060 O&M MANUAL.pdf](https://impaqxprocloudstorage.blob.core.windows.net/9df6bc18-672d-4fba-a58c-c442c9d468f4/a01487af-0d44-42de-af94-c1dfe0c345c0/pdf/COATS%205060%20O&M%20MANUAL.pdf#page=13)
## Demounting the Tire

### ![Figure 28 - Insert Bead Lifting Tool (Optional Drop Center Tools Shown)](image28.jpg)
**9.** Hold lifting tool in place and depress the table top control pedal momentarily to jog the wheel a short distance. Check the wheel and tire to verify that operation is not causing damage.

### ![Figure 29 - Pull Lifting Tool Down and Rotate Wheel](image29.jpg)
**10.** The lifting tool can usually be removed after jogging the wheel a short distance. Continue to jog the wheel to allow the tire to flex where it crosses the rim edge. Continue short rotations until the top bead is completely demounted.

### ![Figure 30 - Remove Drop Center Tools Before Tool Head](image30.jpg)
**11.** Demount lower bead. In most cases when demounting performance tires, the lower bead will be less difficult. Use help to lift, position, and hold the tire. Pay close attention to sensor/transmitter location, and position it directly below the demount tool when starting the lower bead demount procedure (Figure 31).

### ![Figure 31 - Use Help on Lower Bead, Watch Sensor](image31.jpg)

---

## Performance Tires and Wheels - Mounting

**1.** Lubricate both tire beads liberally. Performance tires will require more lubrication than standard passenger car tires.

**2.** Mount the lower bead. In most cases, the lower bead will mount easily.

### ![Figure 32 - Mount Upper Bead, Use Lifting Tool](image32.jpg)
**3.** Position the valve stem directly across from the mount/demount tool for top bead mounting. Lift the top bead over the rear of the mount head. Use the lifting tool to help push and keep the top bead in the drop center during mounting, or use an optional drop center tool to help hold the bead in the drop center (Figures 32 and 33). Rotate the wheel in short steps and apply extra lubricant to mount the upper bead.

**AG:** Mounting the top bead can be very difficult when mounting new tires on performance and custom wheels. Proceed slowly and cautiously.

### ![Figure 33 - Mounting Top Bead](image33.jpg)

## Mounting the Top Bead

4. Mount the top bead using short rotations of the wheel. On stiff sidewall tires, add a second drop center tool to keep the bead in the drop center.  
   *Figure 34 - Add Second Drop Center Tool*

5. On extremely tight tire and wheel combinations, it may be necessary to use the hooked end of the bead lifting tool to flip the tire over the rim flange.  
   *Figure 35 - Use Hooked End of Bead Lifting Tool*

6. After beads are mounted, unclamp the wheel, lift it slightly, and move the clamps to the center of the table top. With the tire/wheel loose on the table top, follow the detailed instructions provided in the **Inflation** section of this manual for bead sealing, bead seating, and inflation.

---

## Custom and Special Wheels

> **⚠ CAUTION**  
> If a custom wheel is damaged in mounting or dismounting, **STOP**, and avoid damaging the other wheels. Continue only when the cause is identified and corrected.

### Alloy Wheels
Some manufacturers offer wheels with little or no drop center. These are not DOT approved. The tire or wheel - or both - can be damaged and the tire could explode under pressure, resulting in serious injury or death. If you attempt to mount/demount this type of wheel, use extreme caution.  
*Figure 36 - No Drop Center*

### European Performance Wheels (Asymmetrical Hump)
Some European wheels have very large humps except near the valve hole. On these wheels, the beads should be loosened at the valve hole on both the upper and lower sides first.  
*Figure 37 - Asymmetrical Hump on European Wheels*

### Wheels with Low Pressure Warning Sensors
Performance wheels on some vehicles (including **Corvette, BMW, Lamborghini Diablo**) have a pressure sensor strapped to the rim opposite the valve hole. On these wheels, the beads should be loosened at the valve hole on both upper and lower sides first.  
*Figure 38 - Wheels with Low Pressure Sensor*

---

## Tube Type Tires

### Mounting
1. Avoid pinching or forcing the tube.
2. Apply rubber lubricant to the beads of the tire.
3. Mount the bottom bead.
4. Round out the tube with a small amount of air.
5. Apply rubber lubricant to the tube.
6. Insert the tube into the tire.
7. Mount the top bead.

### Demounting
1. After tire beads are loosened, **lubricate the beads and rim liberally**.
2. Position demount head and bead lifting tool as described in steps 7 through 11 on pages 4 and 5. Depress table top pedal and rotate only a short distance at a time. This allows you to stop the process should the tube get pinched.
3. After upper bead is demounted, remove tube and demount lower bead.

# STAGES OF INFLATION

Review these descriptions and diagrams carefully. Refer to them as necessary during bead sealing, bead seating, and inflation to verify that you are proceeding properly and safely.

## Bead Sealing

A 140 PSI air blast from the table top jets creates an air curtain to aid in bead sealing. **Never exceed 10 PSI in the tire during bead sealing.** The tire will contain about 1/2 to 2 PSI when bead seal is obtained.

![Bead Sealing Diagram](image1.png)

- Requires rubber lubricant on both upper and lower beads.
- Air flow through valve requires about 140 PSI air pressure drop to ensure sufficient flow on difficult tires.
- Lift tire up to assist seal on top side.

## Bead Seating

Bead seating usually occurs on the long tapered side of the wheel first and the shorter side last. Bead seating will usually require at least **7 PSI** in the tire. **40 PSI is the maximum safe pressure** at this stage regardless of tire operating pressure.

Most European import cars and many aftermarket alloy wheels are very tight and can be difficult to bead seat. Also note that **asymmetrical hump and run-flat tires are extremely difficult to bead seat.** Follow the tire manufacturer's recommended procedure for bead seating.

![Bead Seating Diagram](image2.png)

- Usually last to "pop" is top side.
- Do not stand over tire during inflation.
- Requires visual confirmation of bead seat.

## Inflation

After the beads are seated, the tire is inflated. **Do not inflate the tire above the manufacturer's recommended pressure** as stamped on the tire sidewall. The typical inflation pressure for automobile tires is between **24 and 45 PSI.** Light truck inflation pressure typically covers a wider range.

## MIS-MATCHED TIRES AND WHEELS

**Never attempt to mount and inflate mis-matched tires and wheels.**

> ⚠️ **DANGER**  
> Mis-matched tire and wheel combinations explode, causing personal injury or death to operator and bystanders.

For safety, **do not attempt to mount and inflate mis-matched tires and wheels.**

![Mis-Matched Tires Diagram](image3.png)

- **Half Size Tires:** 14.5, 15.5, 16.5, 17.5, etc.
- **Even Size Wheels:** 14.0, 15.0, 16.0, 17.0, etc.
- **Even Size Tires:** 14.0, 15.0, 16.0, 17.0, etc.
- **Half Size Wheels:** 14.5, 15.5, 16.5, 17.5, etc.
- **Bead will not seat properly.**
- **Note the gap in this area.**
- **Note 15° Bead Seat.**

# Pressure Limiter Maintenance

The pressure limiter helps prevent inflation of standard size or larger tires or tubes beyond 60 PSI to minimize risk of explosion. This device is for the safety of the operator and bystanders. Proper operation of the pressure limiter is essential to safe operation of the machine.

Check operation of the pressure limiter as shown and described below at least monthly:

1. Remove tires and/or wheels from the machine.
2. Connect the inflation hose to an empty service tank with a pressure gauge (gauge should read 0). Use a tank with a 250 PSI pressure rating.
3. Depress inflation pedal to position 1 to start air flow through the hose and into the tank. Maintain a steady pressure for constant flow.
4. Watch the rising pressure on the tank gauge and the gauge on the machine. Machine gauge should cycle between check and inflation pressures while tank gauge climbs steadily. As tank pressure reaches 60 PSI, the pressure limiter should stop the air flow automatically. Both gauges should read 60 PSI ± 5 PSI.
5. Release inflation pedal. Check manual release valve function by pressing the button and releasing pressure from the tank until it reaches 50 PSI. Disconnect inflation hose, and release air inside tank.
6. **Replace pressure limiter** if it fails to cycle properly during inflation, if it fails to shut air supply off at 60 PSI, or if it malfunctions in any other way. **Do not operate machine with a faulty pressure limiter.**

## ⚠️ DANGER
**Operating a tire changer with a defective, improperly adjusted, or by-passed pressure limiter could cause an operator to accidentally over-pressurize a tire, resulting in a tire explosion with severe injury or death to the operator or bystanders.**  
Always be sure that the pressure limiter is present and is operating properly on the machine at all times.

## ⚠️ DANGER
**Never inflate tire above manufacturer’s recommended pressure after bead is seated.**  
Pressure limiter is set at 60 PSI. Any required inflation above 60 PSI should be performed in an inflation chamber/safety cage or securely mounted on the vehicle if an inflation chamber is not available.  
A tire explosion may cause personal injury or death to operator or bystanders.

# ONE WORD FOR SAFETY  
## R.I.M.  
### READ | INSPECT | MOUNT  

### READ...  
Mounting and inflating the wrong size tire can get you hurt. *Read* the size on the tire and make sure it matches the rim. Be especially careful about putting a smaller tire on a larger rim, such as a 16-inch tire on a 16.5-inch rim.  

Inflation of a mismatched tire and rim can cause an explosion.  

### INSPECT...  
Before you put any tire on a rim, *inspect* the rim for rust, tough spots, bent edges, or cracks that could prevent the tire from seating right. If you spot any of these problems, don’t mount the tire until the rim has been checked by your shop foreman.  

*Inspect* the tire for bead damage.  

### MOUNT...  
Once you’ve made sure the tire is OK and the right size and the rim is OK, *mount* the tire safely. NEVER, ever lean over the tire when you’re inflating it. If a tire does explode, it will go straight up. You don’t want to be over the tire if that happens. Also, never over-inflate the tire, even if the bead doesn’t seat. Never inflate over 40 PSI. If the tire hasn’t seated, something is wrong. Deflate the tire and check it and the rim again. If it doesn’t work the second time, try another tire.  

## BE CAREFUL OF THESE SITUATIONS:  
1. **Damaged Bead or Beads.**  
2. **Rusty Wheels.** *(particularly in the bead seat area)*  
3. **Bent or Cracked Wheels.**  
4. **Mismatched.**  
   - **A.** *(A mis-match of a 16-inch tire to a 16.5-inch rim causing an explosion)*  
   - **B.** *(16.5-inch tire on a 16-inch rim)*  
5. **Walk-In Tire and Rim.**  
6. **Back Injuries.**  
7. **Hand or Finger Injuries.** *(Hands or fingers too close to inflating tire or bead seats which may cause injury.)*  
8. **Standing Clear.** *(Never put any part of your body over the tire changer during inflation.)*  
9. **Beads will not Seat at 40 PSI.**  
10. **Improper Inflation.**  

**Remember R.I.M. (*Read, Inspect, Mount*) for every tire.**
