- **Name of the manual**  
  *(Model 102XM Maintenance Manual)*
- **Current chapter title**  
  *(example: this page How to Use This Manual)*
- **Current topic**  
  *(example: this page Manual Design)*

## Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals

The electronic version of this document is an Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM). IETMs put service and parts information at your fingertips; no searching for and opening a second file, or searching for the corresponding printed manual. IETMs come in sets (Maintenance and Parts) and are available on iManuals or from your local authorized Raymond Sales and Service Center.

### To use IETMs:
- Place both PDF files (Maintenance Manual and Parts Manual) in the same directory/folder.
- Do **NOT** rename the files.

### Important:
- IETM file names must remain exactly as they are downloaded, and must reside in the same folder. Any changes to the file names, or failure to have the associated IETM PDF files in the same folder will disable the interactive capability of the manuals.
- IETMs require Adobe Reader 9.0 or higher.

**Green** colored text in the Maintenance Manual is âlinkedâ to a specific location in the corresponding Parts Manual. Clicking on a green link automatically opens the corresponding Parts Manual to the appropriate page.

**Blue** colored text in the Maintenance Manual is âlinkedâ to a location within the same manual. Clicking on a blue link automatically takes you to the linked location.

# Section 2. Safety  
## Battery Safety  

### â ï¸ WARNING  
As a battery is being charged, an explosive gas mixture forms within and around each cell. If the area is not correctly ventilated, this explosive gas can remain in or around the battery for several hours after charging. **Make sure there are no open flames or sparks in the charging area.** An open flame or spark can ignite this gas, resulting in serious damage or injury.  

### â ï¸ WARNING  
Battery electrolyte is a solution of sulfuric acid and water. **Battery electrolyte causes burns.** If any electrolyte comes in contact with your clothing or skin, flush the area immediately with cold water. If the solution gets on your face or in your eyes, flush the area with cold water and **get medical help immediately.**  

Wear personal protective equipment to protect eyes, face, and skin when checking, handling, or filling batteries. This equipment includes:  
- Goggles or face shield  
- Rubber gloves (with or without arm shields)  
- Rubber apron  

Make sure a shower and eyewash station are nearby in case there is an accident.  

A battery gives off explosive gases. **Never** smoke, use an open flame, or use anything that gives off sparks near a battery.  

Keep the charging area well-ventilated to avoid hydrogen gas concentration.

## Section 2. Safety

### Battery Safety

Press the red OFF key (**O**) on the keypad *before* disconnecting the battery from the truck at the battery connector. Do **not** break live circuits at the battery terminals. A spark often occurs at the point where a live circuit is broken.

Do **not** lay tools or metal objects on top of the battery. A short circuit or explosion could result.

Keep batteries clean. Corrosion causes shorts to the frame and possibly sparks.

Keep plugs, terminals, cables, and receptacles in good condition to avoid shorts and sparks.

Keep filler plugs firmly in position at all times when not checking the electrolyte level, adding to the cells, or checking the specific gravity.

Make sure the vent holes in the filler plugs are open to permit the gas to escape from the cells.

# Model 102XM Maintenance Manual

## Section 2. Safety

### Static Safety

Electronic circuit boards can contain Electrostatic Discharge Sensitive (ESDS) devices.

Static charges can accumulate from normal operation of the truck as well as movement or contact between non-conductive materials (plastic bags, synthetic clothing, synthetic soles on shoes, styrofoam coffee cups, and so forth).

Accumulated static can be discharged through human skin to a circuit board or component by touching the parts. Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) is also possible through the air when a charged object is put close to another surface at a different electrical potential. *Static discharge can occur without you seeing or feeling it.*

Whenever working on or near static-sensitive electronics, always use static discharge precautions.

1. Put a static discharge wrist strap around your wrist. Connect the ground cord to the wrist strap connector.
2. Connect the ground cord to an unpainted, grounded surface on the truck frame.
3. If you are removing or installing static-sensitive components, put them on a correctly grounded static mat.
4. To transport static-sensitive components, including failed components being returned, put the components in an anti-static bag or box (available from your Raymond Sales and Service Center).

The wrist strap and associated accessories should be tested monthly to verify they are working correctly. The wrist strap contains a one megohm resistor in the strap cord that acts as a fuse for personal protection. If this resistor is open, the strap becomes ineffective.

[Figure 2-3](#) shows the components of the *Raymond* anti-static field service kit, part number **1-187-059**. The kit includes a wrist strap, ground cord, and static-dissipative work surface (mat). Follow the instructions packaged with this kit.

### Figure 2-3. Anti-Static Kit (P/N 1-187-059) With Wrist Strap and Mat

![Anti-Static Kit](#)

**Wrist straps (P/N 1-187-058/001)** are available in quantities of 25, as part number **1-187-058/005**.

A wrist strap tester is available as part number **1-187-060**.

Contact your authorized *Raymond* Sales and Service Center for information.

### Model 102XM Maintenance Manual  

- You always press the red OFF key (**O**) on the keypad and disconnect the battery before you attempt to inspect, service, or repair the lift truck. Discharge residual charge in the power amplifier by connecting a load across the power amplifier's B+ and B- (such as a contactor coil).  
- Check for shorts to frame as identified on **page 5-4**. If any shorts are found, remove them before you proceed with the welding operation.  
- Clean the area to be welded.  
- Protect all truck components from heat, weld spatter, and debris.  
- Attach the ground cable to a clean, unpainted surface as close to the weld area as possible.  
- Do not perform any welding operations near the electrical components.  
- Do not attach the ground cable to fasteners or other removable components.  
- If you must weld near the battery compartment, remove the battery from the truck.  
- When you are finished welding, perform all ground tests and electrical inspections before operating the vehicle.

The Parameter indicator (wheel icon) on the display illuminates when in parameter mode. See *âSpecial Truck Modeâ* on page 3-6. If the horn button is released at the wrong time, turn the truck OFF and start over.  
3. Rotate the thumbwheel in the fork direction to progress forward through the parameters. While the thumbwheel is held and briefly after it is released, both the parameter number and the driver number are displayed. Stop at parameter 10 (PIN code) for the first driver; the default value of â1â is displayed. See *Figure 3-3*.  
4. Press the horn button once to access this parameter. The parameter symbol on the display flashes. Now you can make changes to the value of the first driverâs PIN code. See *Table 3-4*.  

**NOTE:** All parameters can be viewed; however, not all parameters can be changed. Driver parameters may or may not be accessed, depending on the value of parameter 39.  

## Parameter Displays  

When parameters 1 through 5, and 10 are viewed with the service key, both the parameter number (left side of display) and the 1st operator number (right side of display) are shown.  

As the parameter number display progresses through parameters 1 through 10, the display rolls over to the next operator (the operator number increases). If a parameter is changed, it is valid only for the operator shown.

# Model 102XM Maintenance Manual  
## Section 3. Systems Overview  
### Operator Display and Programming  

Operators and operator parameters are scrolled through, Service Parameters 11 through 40 are displayed.  

To quickly display/access a Service Parameter, rotate the thumb control away from the forks (sequence backwards through the parameters/operators).  

## Setting Individual PIN-key Codes  

1. **Connect the service key at J41.** See [âSpecial Toolsâ on page 3-18](#). Make sure that the Main ON/OFF switch is ON.  
2. **Enter Special Truck Mode.** See [âSpecial Truck Modeâ on page 3-6](#).  
3. **Press and hold the horn button until âPâ is displayed.** The parameter indicator (wheel icon) is illuminated. If the horn button is released at the wrong time, turn the truck OFF and start over.  
4. **Use the thumb control to scroll through the service parameters.** While the thumb control is held and briefly after it is released, both the parameter number (on the left side of the display) and the operator number (on the rightâthis only occurs if the service key is connected) are displayed. Stop (release the thumb control) at parameter 10 (PIN-key code) (See [âParameter 10â on page 3-12](#)) for the first operator; the default value of â1â is displayed.  
5. **Press the horn button once to access this parameter.** The parameter symbol on the display flashes. Now you can make changes to the value of the first operatorâs PIN-key code.  

   > â  **CAUTION**  
   > Changing the 1st operatorâs PIN-key code alters default operation. You will not be able to press â1â and green ON ( I ) to power the truck unless an operatorâs PIN-key code is set to â1.â  

6. **Rotate the thumb control in the fork direction to increase the PIN-key code value, or in the operator direction to decrease the value.** Holding the thumb control in a direction for a time helps quickly advance to larger numbers (for example, codes greater than 100). The PIN-key code can be from one to four digits long. Release the thumb control when the desired value is reached.  
7. **Press the horn button again to confirm the new PIN-key code value.** The parameter symbol on the display stops flashing.  
8. **To enable additional operators; rotate the thumb control in the fork direction to roll over to the second operator, and stop at parameter 10.** The default value of â0â is displayed. Follow the previous steps for the desired number of different PIN-key codes you want to set up. There are a total of ten operators.  

   **NOTE:** Disabling all operators (all PIN-key code values = 0) prohibits truck operation without the service key.  

   **NOTE:** Use unique PIN-key codes to avoid confusion. If two operators have the same PIN-key code, the higher number operatorâs parameters are used. For example, if both the first and second operator PIN-key code is 1111, and the first operatorâs max speed is 80% and the second operatorâs max speed is 90%, when someone logs in with 1111 the max speed used is 90%.

## Parameter Description  

### Parameter 1  
Maximum speed value sent to the power amplifier while in Slow mode except during Turtle Torque (gives torque boost if high load is encountered).  

### Parameter 2  
Top Speed - Reduces the maximum speed value sent to the traction power amplifier while in fast mode (all throttle positions).  

### Parameter 3  
Acceleration - Defines truckâs acceleration characteristics. A lower number results in a less aggressive acceleration.  

### Parameter 4  
Auto-Plug Braking in Neutral - Defines the truckâs automatic plug-braking characteristic when the throttle is reduced (including to neutral). A lower number results in a less aggressive deceleration.  

### Parameter 5  
Automatic Time Off Interval (keypad only) - Sets truck off delay (energy saving feature). If this amount of time passes while the tiller arm is in a brake position and the truck is idle (no outputs requested), the VM powers the truck OFF. When this parameter is set to 0, the truck never powers OFF. If parameter 39 is 1 or 2 (truck doesnât have an optional keypad), the truck never powers OFF.

# Section 3. Systems Overview  
## Model 102XM Maintenance Manual  

### Operator Display and Programming  

## Parameter 10  
Can create up to 10 different PIN codes (need Service Key to access). A Service Key is required to assign up to 10 operators their own PIN-key code (one to four digits) for access to the truck. See *"Setting Individual PIN-key Codes"* on page 3-9.  

**NOTE:** Driver is disabled when set to 0 (2 through 10 driverâs default Pin is 0), if all drivers are disabled the truck cannot be driven without the service key.  

**NOTE:** If two drivers have the same PIN number, the driver with the highest parameter settings is used for both drivers.  

## Parameter 14  
Throttle map adjustment. A negative number allows more featherability at low speeds. A positive number makes the truck more responsive at low speeds. A setting of 0 equals linear response to the handle commands.  

## Parameter 15  
*(starting with software version 3.6)*  

Enables creep travel with the tiller arm in the fully raised or lowered position: â0â disables the option and â1â enables the option. Default setting is â0â, set to â1â at the factory.  

Activate click-to-creep by quickly clicking the speed control in either direction twice with the tiller in the brake position. âSLOâ blinks on the display when in the mode.  

Deactivate by clicking the speed control twice more. Also, the mode deactivates automatically after 10 seconds or immediately if the emergency reverse switch is pushed.  

## Parameter 16  
*(starting with software version 3.6)*  

The travel alarm can be set as follows:  

- **0:** OFF  
- **1:** Traveling Forks-Leading (FL)  
- **2:** Traveling Forks-Trailing (FT)  
- **3:** Traveling FL or FT  
- **4:** Lifting  
- **5:** Lifting or Traveling  
- **6:** Lifting or Traveling FT  
- **7:** Lifting or Traveling FL or Traveling FT  
- **8:** Lowering  
- **9:** Lowering or Traveling FL  
- **10:** Lowering or Traveling FT  
- **11:** Lowering or Traveling FL or Traveling FT  
- **12:** Lifting or Lowering  
- **13:** Lifting or Lowering or Traveling FL  
- **14:** Lifting or Lowering or Traveling FT  
- **15:** Lifting or Lowering or Traveling FL or Traveling FT  

## Parameter 20  
You choose the hour meter you want to display:  

- **1 (A):** Key time  
- **2 (b):** Activity time (drive, lift, or lower)  
- **3 (c):** Traction motor time  
- **4 (d):** Coast drive time  
- **5 (S):** Time to service  

**NOTE:** If Parameter 25 is set to 0, the power-on 5-second hour meter display is skipped and 5 (S) is not shown during hour meters special truck mode.  

**NOTE:** Time to service decrements the value of Parameter 25 until it reaches 0.  

**NOTE:** As 5 (S) decrements, 2 (b) increments at the same rate.

# Model 102XM Maintenance Manual

## Section 3. Systems Overview

### Parameter 21

Defines battery capacity (amp-hr. rating) used to determine a rate for the battery discharge indicator. A higher number represents a larger capacity battery. The higher the number, the longer it takes for the battery discharge indicator to decrease.

#### Determining Optimum Parameter 21 Setting - Flooded Lead Acid Batteries

Flooded Lead Acid Batteries frequently need water added. Use the following procedure when using Flooded Lead Acid Batteries.

1. Check the specific gravity of a fully charged battery. The specific gravity reading should be between 1.27 and 1.29.
2. Operate the truck under normal conditions until you reach the point of lift cutout, 0% on the display. The battery should be 80% discharged.
3. Let the battery set for at least two hours without using it or charging it. Check the specific gravity (SG). If the specific gravity is near, but not below 1.15, the present Parameter 21 setting is good. If the SG is less than or not near 1.15, perform the remaining steps.

   **NOTE:** A reading greater than 1.15 reduces the risk of damaging the battery.

   **NOTE:** The specific gravity can vary between battery manufacturers. See the battery manufacturerâs information for the exact discharge specifications.

4. To increase the specific gravity, you must decrease the present Parameter 21 value. To decrease the specific gravity, you must increase the present Parameter 21 value. Increase or decrease, as applicable, the present value one digit at a time. **Do not** make big changes.
5. Fully charge the battery and repeat steps 2 and 3. Adjust per step 4 and repeat as necessary until the desired results are obtained.

### Determining Optimum Parameter 21 Setting - Maintenance Free Batteries

Use the following procedure when working with Maintenance Free Batteries.

1. Charge the battery. Operate the truck under normal conditions until you reach the point of lift cutout, 0% on the display, the battery should be 80% discharged.
2. Let the battery set for at least two hours without using it or charging it. After two hours, measure the voltage of the battery. If the discharge voltage meets the manufacturerâs specifications, the present Parameter 21 setting is good. If the discharge voltage does not match the manufacturerâs specifications, perform the remaining steps.

   **NOTE:** The discharge voltage can vary between battery manufacturers. See the battery manufacturerâs information for the exact discharge specifications.

3. To increase the discharge voltage, you must decrease the present Parameter 21 value. To decrease the discharge voltage, you must increase the present Parameter 21 value. Increase or decrease, as applicable, the present value one digit at a time. **Do not** make big changes.
4. Fully charge the battery and repeat steps 1 and 2. Adjust per step 3 and repeat as necessary until the desired results are obtained.

### Parameter 25

Sets the service time. C29 is displayed when the time has expired.

**NOTE:** To reset the service timer, access this parameter without changing the value.

**NOTE:** To disable the service timer, set this parameter to 0.

**NOTE:** This parameter is related to Parameter 20.

## Section 3. Systems Overview  
### Programmable Maintenance Tool  

**NOTE:** On trucks with the dual Main ON/OFF switch, the wiring harness changed. For the PMT to connect and display controller information, the Main ON/OFF switch must remain in the ON position.  

- Leave the Main ON/OFF switch in the ON position. Turn OFF the truck by using the key switch, keypad, or by disconnecting wire #20 or wire #22 from the âdualâ Main ON/OFF rocker switch (for Raymond trucks incorporating a âdualâ rocker switch).  
- When the Programmable Maintenance Tool is connected to the truck and displaying controller information, restart the truck by using the key switch, keypad, or reconnecting wire #20 or #22 to the dual Main ON/OFF rocker switch.  

The optional Programmable Maintenance Tool (PMT) (P/N 950-180 or 950-185/002) permits you to test and diagnose the power amplifier in the truck. See **Figure 3-6**.  

**Figure 3-6. Programmable Maintenance Tool (P/N 950-185 shown)**  

The PMT is powered by the power amplifier through a four-pin connector at the bottom of the power amplifier. See **Figure 3-7**.  

### Special Tools  

**Figure 3-7. Connecting PMT to Power Amplifier (P/N 950-185/002 shown)**  

The **Menu Navigation Key** moves the screen cursor up or down through the Menu list (top or bottom arrow), and opens or closes Sub-Menus (right or left arrows).  

**Figure 3-8. Programmable Maintenance Tool**  

The **Data Inc/Dec Key** changes the value of the parameter indicated by the cursor.  

The **Bookmark Keys** allow you to quickly go back to your favorite selections without having to navigate back through the Menu.  

- To select a position in the menu, hold a Bookmark Key down for three seconds until the bookmark set screen is displayed.

1. Press the red OFF ( **O** ) key on the keypad.  
2. Remove the tractor cover.  
3. Connect the PMT to the power amplifier. Wait for the PMT to âboot upâ before proceeding to the next step.  
4. Enter the PIN key code and press the green ON ( **|** ) key on the keypad or turn key switch ON.  
5. Use the Menu Navigation Key to select **Monitor**.  
6. Press the right arrow on the Menu Navigation Key to enter the sub-menu.  
7. Use the Up and Down arrows on the Menu Navigation Key to scroll through the sub-menu list of monitor variables.  
8. Use the right arrow to select and view a single variable.  
9. To change the value of the parameter, use the Data Inc/Dec Key. Alternately, you can press the right arrow Menu Navigation Key once more and enter the detail screen. A bar graph appears as well as minimum and maximum data points. Change the parameter value by pressing the Data Inc/Dec Key. The new value is set as soon as the Data Inc/Dec Key is released.  

To close a Monitor Menu, sub-menu, or detail screen, press the left arrow on the Navigation Key.  

## Faults Mode  

In **System Faults** mode, currently active faults detected by the controller are displayed.  

In **Faults History** mode, the controllerâs diagnostic history file is displayed. This field includes a list of all faults observed and recorded by the controller since the history was last cleared.  

**NOTE:** Each fault is listed only once, regardless of the number of times it occurred.  

1. Press the red OFF ( **O** ) key on the keypad.  
2. Remove the tractor cover.  
3. Connect the PMT to the power amplifier. Wait for the PMT to âboot upâ before proceeding to the next step.

## Section 3. Systems Overview  

## TruckCom  

**NOTE:** TruckCom is used on trucks with Vehicle Managers (P/N 1067833-003 and below) that are not compatible with FlashWare.  

This information is valid for TruckCom version 3.6.  

**NOTE:** Previous versions of TruckCom will not work once TruckCom 3.6 is installed. If you use both TruckCom and TruckComSE, both versions must be updated to the new versions.  

## General  

TruckCom is a communication program that communicates with trucks equipped with CAN (Controller Area Network) communication.  

It enables the following tasks to be performed:  

- Downloading truck control software.  
- Viewing and adjusting operator/truck parameters and hour meters. Additionally, the truckâs parameter set (including hour meter values) can be saved to file and reloaded later.  
- Viewing diagnostic data for various digital inputs/outputs and analogue data including voltages, currents, and certain temperatures.  

The program is a Windows program running under WindowsÂ® 95/98, WindowsÂ® XP/2000, and WindowsÂ® NT.  

## Connection  

A USB CAN interface of the CPC-USB type (P/N 230489/001) is needed to connect TruckCom to the truck, with cable (P/N 163793). Connect the interface via the USB port on a PC. Connect the cable between the interface and the truckâs CAN terminal.  

A Parallel port to CAN interface of the CPC-PP type (P/N 163792) is available to connect TruckCom to the truck, with cable (P/N 163793). Connect the interface via the printer port on a PC. Connect the cable between the interface and the truckâs CAN terminal.  

The CAN interface is supplied with power from the truck and PC electronics and is protected from any high voltages in the truck if a fault should occur.  

When TruckCom is opened, the type of interface must be selected (under the setting tab dropdown) before attempting to scan for nodes.

<tr>
<td><strong>Battery</strong></td>
<td>Check the weight stamped on the battery in the pallet truck against the minimum and maximum allowable weights on the spec tag for the pallet truck. Report any pallet trucks that are running with batteries below the minimum or over the maximum allowable weight. Inspect all battery connectors and leads for damage and cuts in protective coatings. Make sure the battery has no more than 0.5 inch (13 mm) free play in any direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Brakes</strong></td>
<td>During normal operation, with a rated load and traveling at top speed, the pallet truck should stop within approximately six feet. Stopping distance depends on the load, floor, and tire condition. Examine for signs of oil on the friction disc and mating surfaces. If oil is present, disassemble the brake and replace the friction disc. Clean the mating surfaces. Measure the thickness of the friction disc. Replace the friction disc if worn to 0.20 in. (5 mm). Measure for correct gap between the coil housing and pressure plate. When applied, the gap should be between 0.008 and 0.010 in. (0.20 to 0.25 mm). Failure to keep the brakes adjusted causes premature pad and rotor wear and excessive motor heat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Contactor</strong></td>
<td>Inspect contactor tips for burnt or pitted surfaces. Failure to replace the tips may prevent the contactor from opening or closing, causing unscheduled downtime. With the truck OFF and the battery disconnected, check the plunger for smooth operation with no binding. If binding occurs, the pallet truck may malfunction or exhibit intermittent fault codes. See <a href="#">âContactor Tip Inspectionâ on page 4-7</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Control Handle Assembly</strong></td>
<td>Make sure steering function is smooth and responsive, without binding or excess play. Verify lift/lower function is smooth and controllable. Verify travel function is smooth and responsive through full range of acceleration and plugging. Verify no codes on display. Verify function of all switches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Arm Angle Switches</strong></td>
<td>Check the adjustment. See <a href="#">âArm Angle Switches Adjustmentâ on page 7-49</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Drive Unit</strong></td>
<td>Inspect for leaks. Check fluid level. Check drive unit axle for play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Electrical Cables</strong></td>
<td>Inspect all power cables for nicks or cuts. Give special attention to those cables that are not stationary, for example, cables to the traction motor. Replace any cable that is damaged or shows signs of excessive heat. Failure to do so may cause intermittent system shutdowns and/or electronic failures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Forks, Pull Rod, and Lift Linkage</strong></td>
<td>Check the lift-limit switch for lift motor cut-out. Adjust if necessary. Check for wear on the pull rod. Check all lift linkage bushings for wear. When replacing bushings, inspect the pins for wear. Replace the pins if any wear is evident. Check for wear at the lower link or fork heel. Adjust downstops as necessary. See <a href="#">âDownstop Adjustmentâ on page 7-76</a>.</td>

# Model 102XM Maintenance Manual  
## Section 4. Scheduled Maintenance  

### Contactor Tip Inspection  

Contactor tips have special textured tips that provide mechanical self-cleaning when the contactor opens or closes.  

> â  **CAUTION**  
> When repairing contactors, use only **Raymond** authorized contactor kits.  

When you inspect contactor tips, obey these guidelines:  

- Darkened points do *not* indicate burning.  
- Burning indicates a loss of contact point material.  
- Replace the contact points if there is not sufficient contact point material to last until the next regular inspection or severe pitting is evident.  

*Figure 4-1. Severely Pitted Contactor*  

- The silver alloy part of the point is usable contact material; the copper backing is not usable contact material.  
- Do *not* file, use sandpaper, or emery cloth on the contact points to remove discoloration or minor irregularities. This practice produces a surface more susceptible to sticking.  
- If a cone and crater appear, replace the tips.

## Electrical Troubleshooting Guidelines  

### General  

> **â  WARNING**  
> Block the lift truck so that the drive tire is off the floor whenever a troubleshooting procedure requires turning the truck ON. This prevents accidents caused by unexpected lift truck travel.  
>  
> Use extreme care when the truck is jacked up for any reason. Keep hands and feet clear while jacking the lift truck. After the lift truck is jacked, place solid blocks or jack stands beneath it to support it. Do not rely on the jack alone. See *âJacking Safetyâ on page 2-9.*  

> **â  CAUTION**  
> Unless otherwise directed, disconnect the battery connector when you check electrical circuits or components with an ohmmeter. Electrical current can cause damage to the ohmmeter.  

Many problems are caused by a faulty or dirty battery. Make sure the battery is clean. Check the electrolyte level and state-of-charge. See *âBatteryâ on page 7-32.*  

Save time and trouble by looking for simple causes first.  

Visually inspect all wiring and electrical components for:  

- Loose connections or connectors  
- Loose or broken terminals  
- Damaged terminals, blocks, or strips  
- Broken wiring and shorted conditions (especially those that are close to metal edges or surfaces)  

Use an ohmmeter to check for wiring continuity and shorts.  

Use a Digital MultiMeter (DMM), such as a Fluke meter, for all measurements. Analog meters can give inaccurate readings and load down sensitive electronic circuits enough to cause failure. Make sure meter cables are connected to the correct meter jacks and that the correct function and scale are selected.  

When measuring voltage, connect the positive meter lead to the connector or probe point marked (+) in the test. Connect the negative meter lead to the connector or probe point marked (â).  

Whenever measuring resistance, turn the truck OFF and disconnect the battery connector. Battery current can damage an ohmmeter. Isolate the component from the circuit.  

For troubleshooting DC electric motors, see *âDC Electric Motorsâ on page 5-7.*  

For information on pin, connector, and harness connections, see *âWiring Harnessâ on page 7-39* and *âList of Electrical Symbolsâ on page 5-12.*

## Shorts to Frame  

Shorts to frame is an industry term for unintentional current leakage paths between normally isolated electrical circuits and their metal enclosures.  

Shorts to frame may be metallic connections, such as a wire conductor contacting metal through worn insulation. More often, shorts to frame are resistive âleakageâ paths caused by contamination and/or moisture.  

These leakage paths can result in unwanted electrical noise on the metallic pallet truck structure and can cause incorrect operation.  

Shorts to frame are caused by:  

- Accumulation of dirt  
- Battery electrolyte leakage  
- Motor brush dust

Shorts to frame can occur at numerous locations on a pallet truck, including:  
- Batteries  
- Motors  
- Cables, wiring, and harnesses  
- Heatsinks  
- Bus bars  
- Solenoids  
- Contactors  
- Terminal strips  
- Switches  
- Power panel insulation  
- Circuit card mounts

## Shorts to Frame Test

To test for shorts to frame:

1. **Turn the key switch OFF and disconnect the battery connector.**  

2. **Test the battery for shorts to case:**  
   - Connect a 12V test light to the battery case from battery B+, and then to the battery case from battery Bâ.  
   - If the light illuminates at all, even momentarily, there is a **serious** problem with the battery, either external contamination or internal damage.  
   - **Do not continue** until this condition is corrected. The meter may be damaged if you proceed before correcting this condition.  

   a. Install another battery in the truck and repeat this procedure from Step 1.  
   b. If the test light does not light, continue to the next step.  

3. **Measure current leakage using a DMM:**  
   - Set the DMM on the ampere function.  
   - Measure the current leakage from the battery case to battery B+ and from the battery case to battery Bâ (**not truck B+ and Bâ**).  
   - Begin measuring at the highest ampere scale and work toward the lowest.  
   - A reading of **more than 0.001A (1mA)** indicates a **serious** short. **Do not continue** until this condition is corrected. The meter may be damaged if you proceed before correcting this condition.  

   a. Install another battery in the pallet truck and repeat this procedure from Step 1.  
   b. If the current is **less than 0.0002A (0.2mA)**, go to Step 4.  
   c. If the current is **greater than 0.0002A (0.2mA) and less than 0.001A (1mA)**, remove the battery from the truck, then continue with Step 4.  
   d. Ensure the battery case does not touch the truck frame during the remaining tests.  

4. **Measure resistance with the battery disconnected:**  
   - Use a DMM to measure the resistance from the truck frame to truck B+, to truck Bâ (**not battery B+ and Bâ**), and to all fuses and motors.  
   - A reading of **less than 1000 ohms** indicates a **serious** short. **Do not continue** until this condition is corrected. The meter may be damaged if you proceed before correcting this condition.  

   **To correct the condition, follow these steps:**  
   a. Identify the cause of the short to frame by disconnecting circuit components until the low resistance condition disappears.  
      - **Do not** reconnect components one at a time; leave them disconnected until the low resistance reading disappears.  
      - Prevent disconnected terminals or connectors from touching the truck frame or other conductive surfaces.  

   b. The most likely areas to check are:  
      - Motors  
      - Heatsinks  
      - Power cables  
      - Power circuit components  
      - Control circuit components  

   c. Repair or replace the component causing the low resistance condition. Repeat Step 4.

# Section 5.1 Troubleshooting  
**Model 102XM Maintenance Manual**  

## Electrical Troubleshooting Guidelines  

### Steps for Troubleshooting  

#### Step 1  
d. Reconnect all other components previously disconnected, one at a time, measuring resistance between steps. If a reading is less than 1000 ohms when reconnecting a component, that component or its wiring is faulty; repair or replace as appropriate.  

e. When, after all components are reconnected, and you get readings greater than 1000 ohms, continue with the next step.  

#### Step 2  
5. Reconnect the battery connector and turn the key switch **ON**. If the battery was previously removed, make sure the battery case does not touch the truck frame.  

> **NOTE:** The functions being checked must be energized. Example: to check for shorts to frame in the travel circuit, travel must be requested.  

#### Step 3  
6. Use a **DMM** set to the current function to measure current leakage to the truck frame from truck **B+**, **Bâ** (*not battery B+ and Bâ*), and all fuses and DC motor terminals. Begin measuring at the highest ampere scale and work toward the lowest.  

   - If the current is **less than 0.001A (1mA)**, go to step 7.  
   - If the current is **more than 0.001A (1mA)**, continue with the following steps:  

   a. To identify the cause of the short to frame, disconnect circuit components until the leakage current reads **less than 0.001A (1mA)**. Do not reconnect components one at a time, but leave them disconnected until the leakage current reads **less than 0.001A (1mA)**. Prevent disconnected terminals or connectors from touching the truck frame or other conductive surfaces.  

   b. The most likely areas to check are:  
      - Motors  
      - Heatsinks  
      - Power cables  
      - Power circuit components  
      - Control circuit components  

   c. Repair or replace the component(s) causing the leakage current. Repeat Step 6.  

#### Step 4  
d. Reconnect all other components previously disconnected, measuring current between steps. If a reading is **more than 0.001A (1mA)** when reconnecting a component, that component or its wiring is faulty. Repair or replace as appropriate.  

#### Step 5  
7. When, after all components are reconnected, you get a reading **less than 0.001A (1mA)**, there is no short to frame condition with the truck or the battery. If you previously removed the battery from the truck, re-install the battery.

## DC Electric Motors  

### DC Motor Types  

- A **shunt-wound motor**, such as the traction motor, has four external connections: two armature (A) and two field (E). See **Figure 5-1**.  

  **Figure 5-1. Shunt-Wound Motor Circuits**  
  ![Shunt-Wound Motor](image-placeholder)  

- A **compound motor**, such as the lift motor, has only two external connections because the armature and field windings are connected internally. See **Figure 5-2**.  

  **Figure 5-2. Compound Wound Motor Circuits**  
  ![Compound Motor](image-placeholder)  

## Inspection  

Inspect the commutator for surface condition and high mica. Most armatures have the mica undercut. If the armature on your motor does not, do not attempt to cut it. See **Figure 5-3**.  

  **Figure 5-3. Mica Inspection**  
  ![Mica Inspection](image-placeholder)  

The commutator must be smooth and clean to provide maximum brush life. When commutators are not correctly maintained, carbon dust can collect in the grooves between the segments. This can lead to a short circuit in the armature.  

Good commutation is indicated by a dark brown polished commutator and an evenly polished brush wearing surface. See **Table 5-1, "Commutator Surfaces."**  

If the commutator appears rough, pitted, or has signs of burning or heavy arcing between the commutator bars, remove the motor for service.  

## Service  

If the commutator requires service, you must remove the armature from the motor.  

**DO NOT** use a stone to even out high and low spots on the commutator.  

Servicing a motor for an abnormal commutator surface condition and high mica or mica undercutting requires special equipment at a motor rebuilding facility.

## Open Circuit Motor Test  

An open circuit is an electrical circuit within the motor that is broken. This can be caused by:  

- Bad brushes or brush springs  
- A broken wire in the field or armature winding  
- A loose or bad connection  

### To test a motor for an open circuit:  

1. Isolate the motor from the truck circuit by removing the power cables. Use two wrenches to avoid twisting the terminal stud.  
2. With the motor at room temperature, connect the leads of a digital ohmmeter between the individual circuits in the motor.  
3. Observe the measurements given in **Table 5-2**.  
4. If the meter indicates high resistance in the armature, check the condition of the brushes before replacing the motor.  
5. If an open circuit is found in a motor, the motor must be disassembled by a motor rebuilding facility to isolate the problem to the field or armature circuit.

# Section 5.1 Troubleshooting  
**Model 102XM Maintenance Manual**  

## DC Electric Motors  

### Grounded Motor Test  

In a grounded motor, an unintentional electrical connection exists between the current-carrying conductors and the motor housing. This can be caused either by direct contact or through conductive foreign material.  

The ground may be caused by:  

- Insulation breakdown  
- Brush leads touching the motor housing  
- Build-up of carbon dust or other materials  

#### To test a motor for grounds:  

1. Isolate the motor from the truck circuit by removing the power cables. Use two wrenches to avoid twisting the terminal studs.  
2. Attach one lead of a megohm meter or a digital ohmmeter to a motor terminal and the other lead to an unpainted surface of the motor housing. Set the ohmmeter to the highest scale.  
3. If the ohmmeter reads resistance of less than 100,000 ohms, the motor is grounded. Clean, repair, or replace the motor as necessary.  

### Short-Circuited Armature  

A short circuit in the armature causes heating and can result in burning of:  

- Armature coil  
- Brush wires  
- Commutator segments  

Visual inspection may reveal this condition.  

Positive determination of a short-circuited armature requires special equipment at a motor rebuilding facility.  

### Short-Circuited Winding  

A short-circuited winding is one where the insulation on the field or armature has broken down at two or more points. The breakdown creates a low resistance path, permitting current to flow from one turn of the coil to another adjacent coil turn, without actually flowing through the coil wire. The result is a decrease in the total resistance of the motor winding and an increase in the current flow. The severity of the short circuit depends on its location.  

A shorted motor may be indicated by:  

- Slow or sluggish operation  
- Running faster than normal  
- Overheating  
- Blowing a power fuse  
- On DC motors, severe burning or discoloring on one or two commutator segments every 90Â° of rotation  

These symptoms can also be caused by problems other than the motor itself, such as:  

- Brake too tight or dragging  
- Wheel bearings too tight  
- Faulty transmission  
- Binding in an attached pump  

Testing a motor for short-circuited windings requires special equipment at a motor rebuilding facility.

## Section 5.1 Troubleshooting  
### Hydraulic Troubleshooting Guidelines  

When you measure the voltage at solenoids, make sure the hydraulic lines and components are fully installed.  

Use an ohmmeter to measure wiring continuity to solenoids. Use an ammeter to measure for the correct current to the solenoids and contactor coils.  

> â  **CAUTION**  
> Unless otherwise directed, disconnect the battery connector when you examine electrical circuits or components with an ohmmeter. Electrical current can damage the ohmmeter.  

Visually inspect all hydraulic lines and components for:  

- Leaking connections or connectors  
- Loose or broken fittings  
- Damaged tubing, hoses, vents, or seals  

Inspect the hydraulic system for the correct pressure and that the relief valve is functioning correctly. See *"Hydraulic Pump Pressure Relief Valve Adjustment" on page 7-68.*  

Check the hydraulic reservoir fluid level. If necessary, add fluid; fill until fluid is visible to within 1 in. (25.4 mm) below the fill port elbow. The usable reservoir capacity is 0.8 qt. (0.75 L). See *"Lubrication Equivalency Chart" on page A-2.*  

> **NOTE:** Always check hydraulic fluid level with forks fully lowered and when hydraulic fluid is cold.  

Cap any open hydraulic lines to prevent contamination.

## Load Drifting/Settling  

| Possible Cause | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| Contaminated or bad check valve | Check for contamination in the hydraulic fluid. If contamination is present, flush, fill, and bleed the hydraulic system. Clean the check valve. If no contamination is found, replace the check valve. |
| Leaking or contaminated lowering solenoid valve | Check for contamination in the hydraulic fluid. If contamination is present, flush, fill, and bleed the hydraulic system. Clean the solenoid valve. If no contamination is found, replace the solenoid valve. |

# Model 102XM Maintenance Manual  
## Section 6. Messages and Codes  
### Messages and Caution Codes  

## Code C28  

| Code Title       | Main ON/OFF Switch Warning |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Operator Display** | C28 |
| **System Response** | Truck functions are not allowed after this code is set. |
| **Alarm Sounds** | No |
| **Reason** | Traction power amplifier could not be reset via the CAN-bus at power-on, or the traction power amplifier reports the Main ON/OFF switch is open. |

### Tests to Run  
1. **Main ON/OFF switch not activated when the key switch was turned ON.**  
2. **Low voltage to the traction power amplifier** (especially while lifting or driving) due to over-current or short-circuit.  
   - a. Try a known-good battery.  
3. **PTC R1 missing, faulty, or tripped** (should be 18 ohms).  
   - **Note:** A very high resistance is possible due to excessive current while the main contactor is open. It should automatically recover.  
   - a. Carefully check to see if R1 is hot (tripped). If so, unplug the battery and allow it to cool. Locate the low impedance path that tripped R1 and correct.  
4. **Check the K30 Relay.**  
5. **Wire #24 near 0V.**  
   - a. Check that J5 is connected, check the fuse, and check the wiring.  
6. **Check for Shorts to frame.**  
   - a. Check for 24V at J5-16.  
7. **Short or open circuit in the CAN wiring, or electrical noise in the CAN wiring** due to a bad connection or outside interference, both at power-on.  
   - a. Check the CAN wiring.  
8. **Faulty traction power amplifier.**  
   - a. Check the power wiring.  

### How to Clear Code  
**Turn the Main ON/OFF switch to ON.**

## Tire Replacement  

Any misalignment of the tire and hub while the tire is being pressed on the hub can cause damage to the hub. For this reason, chamfers are provided on the outside edge of the hub and on the end of the inside diameter of the tireâs metal insert. The chamfers help to center the hub and tire during pressing and to reduce the possibility of misalignment.  

> â ï¸ **CAUTION**  
> To prevent damage, the hub must be installed on the circular ram with the chamfered side up.  

1. Check the inside surface of the metal insert on the new tire. Remove any scaling or rust with sandpaper. Clean the inside of the metal insert.  
2. Place a circular ram on the press table. The length of the ram must be longer than the width of the old tire to permit complete removal of the old tire. The outside diameter of the ram must be small enough to fit loosely in the insert of the tire but must be large enough to rest squarely on the flat surface on the outer edge of the hub. See **Figure 7-23**.  

   ![Tire Replacement](image-placeholder)  
   *Figure 7-23. Tire Replacement*  

3. If the outside edge of the hub is not flush with the edge of the metal insert in the old tire, measure how far the hub is recessed inside the tire. The new tire must be...

## Drive Wheel  

Placed in the same position the old tire was installed on the hub. You can use a spacer (slightly smaller in diameter than the inside diameter of the tire insert and the same thickness as the depth of the recess) to obtain the correct amount of recession.  

1. Position the hub assembly with the old tire on top of the circular ram so the outside of the wheel is positioned upward. The outside edge of the hub has a chamfer to help guide the new tire on the wheel. The chamfered edge must always be the leading edge when a tire is pressed on the hub.  
2. Center the hub assembly on top of the ram and make sure they mate squarely.  
3. Position the new tire with its chamfered insert facing the hub. Align the new tire and the hub so they are concentric.  
4. Begin pressing the new tire on the hub and the old tire off the wheel. Run the press slowly for the first few inches of travel because this is the critical step of the operation. If the tire starts to cock, stop the press immediately and realign the tire. Use a soft-headed mallet to realign the tire on the hub.  

   **NOTE:** If the new tire does not press on with a minimum pressure of 5 tons (68,947 kPa), replace the hub.  

5. Release the press. Remove the wheel, tire assembly, and the old tire from the press table. Inspect the wheel and tire assembly.

## Drive and Brake  

### **Drive Wheel Installation**  

1. Inspect the drive wheel studs for damage or looseness. Replace any damaged studs. Use the following procedure to tighten loose studs:  
   a. Remove and clean the studs.  
   b. Install two lug nuts, jammed together, to the end of the stud. This allows tightening of the studs using a torque wrench.  
   c. Apply thread accelerator/primer (P/N 990-666) to the studs.  
   d. Apply thread-locking compound (P/N 990-571) to the studs.  
   e. Install the studs and torque to 23 to 28 ft. lbs. (32 to 38 Nm).  

   **NOTE:** Do not over-tighten the studs. If tightened to more than 30 ft. lbs. (41 Nm), the studs start to cut new threads and go in too far, hitting the lip seal. If the lip seal is damaged due to studs being installed too far, the axle must be replaced.  

   f. Remove the nuts on the studs. Make sure the studs do not rotate.  

2. Install the wheel and tire assembly on the drive axle of the truck.  
3. Install the five drive wheel mounting nuts. Torque the nuts in at least three steps, starting with a low torque [5 ft. lbs. (7 Nm)]. Torque nuts in a star pattern to make sure that the lugs are centered in the mounting holes. Torque to 55 ft. lbs. (75 Nm) on the final pass.  
4. Remove the blocks.  
5. Install the bumper. See **âBumper Installationâ on page 7-9**.  
6. Reconnect the battery connector. Press the green **ON ( | )** key on the keypad.  
7. Test the operation of the truck.

## Model 102XM Maintenance Manual  
### Electrical Components  

### Charging a Battery  

To charge a battery, direct current is passed through the battery cells in the direction opposite to that of discharge. Charging time is 5% to 20% longer than discharge time.  

The most important element in battery service and prolonging battery life is correct charging. Make sure you follow the approved method for each application, following the battery and battery charger manufacturerâs instructions.  

### â  CAUTION  
**The vent holes in the filler plugs must be open to permit hydrogen gas to escape from the cells. When you charge the battery, make sure the polarity connections are correct. The positive lead of the charger must be connected to the positive terminal, and the negative lead must be connected to the negative terminal.**  

1. Familiarize yourself with the following:  
   - Charging rate, starting rate, and finish rate  
   - Time available for charge  
   - Overheating, excessive gassing, or overcharging  
   - Variations between cell voltage  

2. Battery performance varies depending on the type of application. If you use more than one truck, one battery, and one charger, keep the same batteries and charger assigned to each truck. This makes it easier to diagnose any battery or charging problem.  
3. Consult your battery and battery charger manufacturerâs manual for specific charging procedures.  
4. Wear personal protective equipment. See **"Battery Safety" on page 2-6**.  
5. Press the red **OFF ( O )** key on the keypad, and disconnect the battery.  
6. Inspect the battery.  
7. Examine the electrolyte level in each cell. Electrolyte must cover the top of the...

# Model 102XM Maintenance Manual  
## Section 7. Component Procedures  
### Battery  

## Electrical Components  

Battery plates. If electrolyte level is below the plates, add just enough water to cover the plates. Do not fill to level yet. Electrolyte level increases during charging. See [Adding Water to a Battery](#adding-water-to-a-battery).  

8. Using a hydrometer, measure and record the specific gravity of each cell. See [Battery Specific Gravity](#battery-specific-gravity).  
9. Measure and record the voltage of each cell.  
10. To get the maximum use out of each battery, recharge only when effectively discharged. Routinely recharging batteries when only partially discharged decreases battery life. At maximum recommended discharge, the specific gravity must read **1.140 to 1.160 or less**.  
11. Make sure that the filler plugs are clean and the vent holes are open. Tighten all filler plugs.  

> **â  CAUTION**  
> NEVER plug the battery charger into the truck. This severely damages the truckâs electrical system. Plug the charger **ONLY** into the connector from the battery.  

12. Charge the battery, following specific instructions in your battery and battery charger manufacturerâs manual.  
13. Using a hydrometer, measure the specific gravity of each cell. No amount of charging increases battery capacity or increases specific gravity above its fully charged level (specific gravity **1.280 to 1.300**).  
14. If, after charging, the electrolyte level is below the fill port, add water to move it to the fill level. **Do not overfill the cells or permit electrolyte to spill on the battery case.** See [Adding Water to a Battery](#adding-water-to-a-battery).  

In general, a lead-acid battery may be charged at any rate in amperes that does not cause excessive gassing or produce electrolyte temperatures above **110Â°F (43Â°C)**. Temperatures of **120Â°F (49Â°C)** are permitted only for short periods of time.  

---

## Adding Water to a Battery  

Water must be added to battery cells periodically. Frequency and quantity depend on the water level above the plates and the amount of gassing during charge.  

### Guidelines:  
- Wear personal protective equipment. Use only distilled water or water approved by the battery manufacturer. See [Battery Safety](#).  
- Before charging, make sure battery plates are covered with electrolyte. Add water, if necessary, only to cover plates.  
- Electrolyte level increases during charging. To prevent overflow, add water to fill port, if necessary, after charging, and after hydrometer and voltmeter readings are taken.  
- Keep the outside of the battery case clean and dry.  

---

## Battery Specific Gravity  

Specific gravity readings for lead acid batteries with electrolyte temperatures at **80Â°F (27Â°C)** change with the state-of-charge as follows:  

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Charge</th><th>Specific Gravity</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>100%</td><td>1.280 to 1.300</td></tr>
<tr><td>75%</td><td>1.250 to 1.260</td></tr>
<tr><td>50%</td><td>1.200 to 1.210</td></tr>
<tr><td>25%</td><td>1.150 to 1.160</td></tr>
<tr><td>0%</td><td>1.080</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>  

Most industrial deep-cell discharge batteries are considered discharged when **20% of the charge remains** (specific gravity **1.140**).  

> **NOTE:** Maintenance-free batteries do not require specific gravity measurements.

## Specific Gravity Check  

1. Wear personal protective equipment. See [âBattery Safetyâ on page 2-6](#).  
2. Insert the nozzle of the hydrometer into the battery cell and draw enough electrolyte into the tube to permit the float to ride free.  
3. Leave the hydrometer nozzle in the battery and read the specific gravity of the cell.  
4. If there is not enough electrolyte in the battery to get a hydrometer reading then:  
   - Add just enough water to cover the battery plates.  
   - Charge the battery, then take readings.  
5. Record the specific gravity reading on the battery maintenance chart.  

## Battery Voltage Check  

Perform a voltage check on each cell after performing the specific gravity check.  

1. Attach a voltmeter to the positive and negative terminals of each cell. Voltage readings change with the state-of-charge. See [âBattery Specific Gravityâ on page 7-35](#).  

   <table>
   <thead>
   <tr><th>Charge</th><th>Voltage Reading</th></tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
   <tr><td>100%</td><td>2.14</td></tr>
   <tr><td>75%</td><td>2.07</td></tr>
   <tr><td>50%</td><td>1.95</td></tr>
   <tr><td>25%</td><td>1.80</td></tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>  

2. Record the voltage reading for each cell on the battery maintenance chart. There must be a difference of less than 0.2V between cells.  

## Battery Storage  

Before you store a battery, make sure the electrolyte is at the correct level in all cells, the filler plugs are tight, and the battery is fully charged.  

Store the battery in a clean, cool, dry location away from radiators and other sources of heat. Refer to the storage instructions in your battery manufacturerâs manual.  

Measure the electrolyte level and the specific gravity every 30 days during storage. Whenever the specific gravity is less than 1.230, charge the battery.

## Section 7. Component Procedures  
### Electrical Components  

# Power Cables  

Check the power cables for damage:  
- Evidence of overheating  
- Burned spots in the cable  
- Nicks in the insulation  
- Damaged or overheated terminal lugs  
- Damaged mounting hardware or brackets  

Replace damaged cables or mounting hardware as necessary.  

Power cables are marked on the insulation near the terminal lug with the location where they belong. If the marking is missing or is not readable, remark the cable with the correct information.  

**NOTE:** Replace terminal lugs in the field using the appropriate crimping tools. Crimping tool, lugs, and heat-shrink are available through the Parts Distribution Center. Failure to use correct cables, terminal hardware, and torque values can result in overheating and damage to components.  

## Power Cable Repair  

Traditional lug crimping techniques for power cables on DC motors may not meet the higher current requirements of AC motors. Use Manual Crimp Tool (P/N 1069861) when crimping power cables for all AC motors. This tool may also be used to repair power cables for DC motors, yielding enhanced repair.  

1. Remove the failed cable(s) from the truck.  
2. Using the removed cable(s) for reference, cut an appropriate amount of replacement cable of the same gauge.  
3. Set the adjustment screw on the manual crimp tool head to match the cable gauge.  
4. Referring to Table 7-2 and Table 7-3, strip the cable jacket to fit the terminal to be crimped.

# Wiring Harness  

> â ï¸ **CAUTION**  
> Use correct electrostatic discharge precautions. See ["Static Safety"](page 2-11).  

**NOTE:** For replacement parts information refer to the Parts Manual.  

The wiring harness is designed to connect the electrical components of the pallet truck.  

**Figure 7-33. Wiring Harness**  
*(Image: 6349-008.jpg)*  

All wires in the harness are marked with a wire identification number. These numbers correspond to wire identification given in the Electrical Schematics.  

## Wiring Harness Terminology  

The term **"connector JPx"** means a mated connector consisting of two connector halves. One half contains male connectors, or pins (**P**); the other half contains female connectors, or jacks (**J**).  

When you disconnect a mated **JP** connector, you have two connector halves. The individual connector halves are designated by **"Jx"** and **"Px."**  

For example, **connector JP2** is the mated connector in the control handle. **J2** represents the jack connections. **P2** represents the pin connections.  

## Wiring Harness Inspection  

To find electrical connectors on the truck, refer to the Electrical Schematics.  

Make sure the truck is **OFF** and the battery connector **disconnected** before working on harnesses. Whenever working on the truck, use care around wiring harnesses.  

- Do not pull on wires.  
- Carefully connect and disconnect all connectors.  
- Do not pry apart connectors with unspecified tools.  
- Examine and maintain any added materials used to dress or protect the wire. This includes spiral wrap, brackets, cable ties, fasteners, flexible conduit, and so forth.  
- Check harness wires for abrasions, scrapes, nicks in the wire, damage from overheating or burns, or other general insulation damage.  
- Replace terminations with exposed wire visible at the connectors. Damaged terminations, exposed wires, or damaged connectors can cause operational failure of the truck.  

During troubleshooting and repairs, it is sometimes necessary to unmate a connector, move a harness, cut a cable tie, or remove the wire from a bracket. Note carefully the location of the wire and all protective or securing attachments before moving the harness.  

After repair, return or replace all protective and/or securing hardware to its original condition. Protective materials are necessary to provide reliable performance of the interconnect system.  

In addition to the wire identification number printed every **1 to 1.5 in. (25.4 to 38.1 mm)** on the wire, there is a wire marker at each termination. If the marker is missing or unreadable, remark the wire to permit easier identification.

# Section 7. Component Procedures

## Wiring Harness

**NOTE:** It is normal to find unused connectors for uninstalled options that have had heat shrink applied over them and have been strapped to the harness.

### Wiring Harness Repair

Make sure the truck is **OFF** and the battery connector disconnected before working on harnesses. When pulling a wire out through a bundle, cut off the pin or socket so it does not snag. When replacing wires, in some cases you can tape or solder one end of a new wire to one end of the failed wire. Then you can pull the old wire out of the bundle and pull the new wire into the bundle, all at the same time. Make sure to disconnect the old wire from the new wire.

In other cases, it is easier to secure a new wire to the outside of the existing wire bundle with cable ties of an appropriate size. The failed wire can be left in the bundle, or can be pulled by one end to remove it from the bundle.

When replacing wires, follow these guidelines:

- Use the appropriate tools to remove and insert terminations at each connector.
- Remove damaged terminations and discard. Never reuse a termination from a wire.
- Do not cut away a terminal lug and reuse the wire strands that were crimped into the original lug.
- When stripping wire, use new wire strands for new terminations. Make sure to use a new wire with extra length to allow for cutting and stripping of the ends to install new terminations.
- Use a new wire that is the same gauge (typically gauge **18 AWG**), size, type, and color as the wire it is replacing.
- Use a hand stripper capable of stripping by wire gauge number. Use care not to nick or cut any of the wire strands. Discard and replace a wire with damaged strands. Insert the correct length wire strands into the termination before crimping.

## Wiring Harness Soldering Procedures

To prevent damage from excessive heat when soldering small components in assemblies, follow these guidelines:

- Make sure the soldering tip is clean. A dirty tip does not transfer heat well and encourages long dwell time and greater pressure. Apply light pressure on the terminal.
- **Flux:** Rosin base.
- **Solder:** 60/40 rosin core or equivalent.
- **Solder Iron:** 15-20 watt "pencil-type" maximum.
- **Tip Size:** 3 mm (0.118 in.) diameter x 30 mm (1.182 in.) long screwdriver tip. Make sure the tip is clean.
- After soldering, clean the terminals with a brush dampened with an alcohol-based cleaner (**P/N 990-600/FOF**). **Do not** allow any cleaner to seep into the switches or potentiometers, or contact contamination may occur.

### Electrical Components  
#### Fuses  

**NOTE:** For replacement parts information refer to the Parts Manual.  

Under extreme operating conditions, fuses (F50 and F51) protect the electrical circuits and components from excessive current or voltage overloads. See **Figure 7-34**.  

**Figure 7-34. Fuse/Circuit Breaker Location**  

![Fuse F50 and Fuse F51](image-placeholder)  

### Fuse Test/Inspection  

Examine each fuse for signs of overheating, discoloration, cracking, or other physical damage. Replace the fuse if you find damage.  

To test a fuse, remove it or isolate it from the electrical circuit. Do this by removing the fuse from the truck or by removing all the connections from one side of the fuse.  

Use an ohmmeter set to Rx1 scale and measure the resistance across the fuse. The resistance must be less than 1 ohm.

## Circuit Breaker  

**NOTE:** For replacement parts information refer to the Parts Manual.  

Under extreme operating conditions, the current demand on the battery may exceed the rating for the main circuit breaker (M1) and force it open. This causes the truck to become inoperable until the circuit breaker automatically resets itself.  

### Circuit Breaker Test/Inspection  

Examine the **circuit breaker** for signs of overheating, discoloration, or other physical damage. Replace the circuit breaker if you find damage. See **Figure 7-35**.  

*Figure 7-35. Circuit Breaker Location*  

![Circuit Breaker Location](image-placeholder)  

To test a circuit breaker, remove the circuit breaker from the truck or isolate it from the electrical circuit by removing all the connections from one side. Let it cool (or reset itself).  

Use an ohmmeter set to **Rx1** scale and measure the resistance across the circuit breaker. The resistance must be **less than 1 ohm**.

### Arm Angle Switches (Plastic Switch Bridge)  

A plastic switch bridge was introduced. The plastic switch bridge can be used to service handles originally built with the metal switch bridge as long as the tiller arm is machined above the right cam. See **Figure 7-46**. Handles without the machining must be serviced with a different switch bridge or replaced.  

**Figure 7-46. Tiller Arm Machining Identification**  

Differences are:  
- The new plastic bridge mounts to the handle stem base with a single screw. The bridge has a formed post that fits in the unused screw hole.

## Switch Bridge Replacement  

Use the following procedure to replace an existing switch bridge with the new plastic switch bridge.  

1. Lower the forks completely.  
2. Press the red **OFF ( O )** key on the keypad. Disconnect the battery connector.  
3. Remove the stem mount cover.  

### Switches (General)  

4. Bend the two lower terminals (the center terminal and the one under the actuating arm pivot, not the one under the roller) of the switch up (towards the third terminal) about 20 to 30Âº. See **Figure 7-48**. The diagonal orientation of the terminals causes them to bend to the side to some extent; do not try to force the terminals to remain centered. The top (unused) terminal may be bent if it is in the way. Do not bend the lower terminals more than necessary to fit in the stem head.  
5. Place the switch onto the bracket, with the mounting hole (under the roller) on the molded bracket post. Secure the switch to the bracket using a blunt end self-tapping screw. Tighten just enough to prevent wiggle in the switch as this screw is going into plastic.  
6. Remove the existing switch bridge assembly; do not disconnect the wires.  
7. Remove the P-clamp. Reorient the tiller harness to the inboard side of the bolt to clear the switch. See **Figure 7-49**. Reinstall the P-clamp holding the tiller harness.  

   **NOTE:** Make sure the tiller harness is routed under the pivot pin and between the flange on the spring drum and the plastic washer.  

8. Orient the bridge assembly as it will go in the truck: rollers up and facing the tiller. Remove the wires from the existing switch bridge assembly and install them on the new switches: the wires must remain on the same sides of the truck. Quick connects from the old middle terminals go on the new middle terminals and those from the old upper terminals go on the new lower terminals (closest to the switch lever pivot).  
9. Position the bridge assembly on the stem head. Insert the projecting post into one of the tapped holes in the stem head. Make sure it is seated, or the bridge will break. Apply thread-locking compound (**P/N 990-536**) to the button head screw. Install the screw through the bridge into the other tapped hole in the stem head. Torque to **15 in. lbs. (1.7 Nm)**. Use care not to over-tighten or you may damage the bridge.

10. If operating in freezers or applications that are subject to sticky substances:  
    a. Apply Dow Corning Electrical Compound (P/N 302249-000) around the switch arm as shown in **Figure 7-50**.  

    ![Figure 7-50](image-placeholder)  

    b. For further protection, apply Electrical Compound to the surface that the switch arm roller rides on.  

    c. For terminal protection, apply a generous coating of Electrical Compound, enough so some squeezes out when the harness is connected to the switch terminals, before installing the harness connectors. Make sure the connectors are well seated, as this material is an insulator rather than a conductor.  

> â  **CAUTION**  
> Do not use the Dow Corning Electrical Compound in dusty environments. The compound may retain powder contamination and interfere with switch actuation.  

11. Reconnect the battery connector. Press the green **ON ( | )** key on the keypad.  

12. Test the truck to make sure that the top brake, bottom brake, and the speed transition between them are functioning correctly.  

13. Adjust the switch if necessary.

### Electrical Components  

## Lift-Limit Switch  

When the forks are fully raised, the **lift-limit switch** (S36) turns the hydraulic pump motor **OFF**. This keeps the pump from trying to extend the lift cylinder beyond its maximum travel. See **Figure 7-51**.  

**Figure 7-51. Lift-Limit Switch**  

![Lift-Limit Switch](image-placeholder)  

### Lift-Limit Switch Adjustment  

1. Raise the forks until they reach their fully raised position. If the lift-limit switch does not shut the pump down when the lift cylinder reaches its upper limit, the relief valve on the hydraulic pump makes a high-pitched squeal, indicating that the relief valve is opening.  
2. Press the red **OFF ( O )** key on the keypad. Disconnect the battery connector.  
3. Remove the upper cover to access the lift-limit switch.  
4. Loosen the bolt and slide the switch up or down in the bracket to activate (cut power off) when the lift is **1/2 to 1 in. (12.7 to 25.4 mm)** before the fully raised position.  
5. Tighten the bolt.  
6. Reconnect the battery connector. Press the green **ON ( | )** key on the keypad. Lower the forks and then lift them until they reach their fully raised position. The lift-limit switch must cut power off to the pump when the lift cylinder reaches **1/2 to 1 in. (12.7 to 25.4 mm)** before its fully raised position.  

---

## Switches (General)  

**Figure 7-52.**  

![Lift-Limit Switch Mounting](image-placeholder)  

- **For standard conditioning, use outside mounting holes**  
- **For cold storage, use inside mounting holes**  
- **Once the switch is mounted, this small hole can be seen directly above the switch**  
- **Mount the switch and the adapter block on the right side of the bracket, away from the drive unit.**  

---

## Key Switch  

A two-position **(ON/OFF)** rotary key switch (S17), located on the main console, energizes all truck control functions when in the **ON** position, provided the **Main ON/OFF switch** is in the **ON** position.  

> **NOTE:** Newer version trucks are equipped with a dual **ON/OFF rocker switch** as standard. Rotary key switches are available as an option.  

### Key Switch Inspection  

1. Remove the tractor cover.  
2. With the battery plugged in and the key switch **ON**, battery voltage **B+** must be present on the two terminals of the switch.  
3. Turn the key switch to **OFF**, disconnect the battery and remove the wires from the switch terminals.  
4. Test the key switch for continuity with an ohmmeter.  

   - In the **OFF** position, the ohmmeter must read **greater than 1 megohm**.  
   - In the **ON** position, the ohmmeter must read **less than 1 ohm**.  
   - If not, replace the switch.

# Section 7. Component Procedures  
## Motors, General  

**NOTE:** For replacement parts information refer to the Parts Manual.  

### Motor Brush Inspection  

*Figure 7-53. Traction Motor Brush, Typical Location*  

Conduct a partial inspection of the traction motor after every 1,000 hours of truck operation. If you work in an abnormally severe or caustic environment or if you have a rigorous duty cycle, inspect the motor more frequently.  

Set up and rigidly adhere to a strict inspection schedule to obtain the maximum efficiency from the electrical equipment.  

Each partial inspection of the motor must include the following:  

1. **Inspect the brushes** for wear and for correct contact with the commutator. Record the level of wear on the brushes. This history gives you an indication of whether a brush must be changed or if it can wait until the next inspection. Refer to page 7-55 for acceptable brush length and general motor information.  

   **NOTE:** Overloading a unit is ultimately reflected in the motor and brush wear; therefore, you must take this into account when considering brush replacement.  

2. **Check brush spring tension.** See âMotor Brush Spring Tensionâ on page 7-55.  
3. **Clean brushes and holders.** Wipe the commutator with a dry, lint-free cloth. **DO NOT USE** lubricants of any kind on or around the commutator.  
4. **Check brush holders** for solid connection to the mounting support. Tighten the mounting screws as necessary.  
5. **Check the cap screws** holding the brush cross connectors to the brush holder body.  
6. **Make sure the motor terminals** are secured tightly to the motor frame. Be careful not to strip the threads or crush the insulating parts.  
7. **Check all the cap screws** around the frame for tightness.  
8. **Keep the outside frame** of the motor clean and free from dirt. Maintain a free air passage around the motor to permit heat radiation.  

### Motor Brush Replacement  

If one brush needs replacement, always replace the entire set of brushes.  

Use only **genuine Raymond brushes**. Using another type of brush could damage the commutator or cause excessive brush wear.  

If the end of the brush is not already contoured to fit the commutator, use the following procedure to seat the brush to the commutator.  

**NOTE:** If the motor commutator is not accessible, form the brush contour using a brush seating stone.  

1. Move the motor brush springs out of your way.  
2. Wrap a piece of **00 sandpaper** around the commutator. **DO NOT** use emery cloth to seat brushes.  
3. Move the brushes back down in their holders so that the face of the brushes matches the curve of the commutator.  
4. Remove the sandpaper.  
5. Blow any dust out of the motor with clean, compressed air at a maximum of **30 psi (207 kPa)**.

### Brush Spring Tension Inspection  

1. Press the red OFF ( O ) key on the keypad. Disconnect the battery connector.  
2. Remove the traction motor cover.  
3. Slide the brush up slightly in its holder.  
4. Insert a paper strip between the brush face and the commutator. See Figure 7-54.  

   **Figure 7-54. Motor Brush Spring Tension Inspection**  

5. Place a small leather loop around the coil spring for the brush. If the brush spring has a loop at the brush, hook the spring scale directly to the spring.  
6. Attach a 5 lb. (2.27 kg) spring scale to the leather loop.  
7. While gently pulling the scale outward, slowly pull the paper strip in the direction that the commutator normally rotates.  
8. When the paper strip starts to move freely, the spring scale reads the spring brush tension.  

### Motors, General  

9. Refer to the table below for correct spring tension.

# Section 7. Component Procedures  
## Hydraulic Components  

**NOTE:** For replacement parts information refer to the Parts Manual.  

### General Guidelines  

To prolong the life of your *Raymond* pallet truck, follow these guidelines:  

- Keep all fittings and connections tight to prevent leaks. Use care when tightening fittings. Over-tightening can cause damage or distortion.  
- Before you remove any component from the hydraulic system, wash the component and surrounding area with cleaning solvent to prevent foreign matter from entering the system. Cap and plug all openings immediately.  
- Whenever you remove a fitting with a pipe thread, use a sealing compound on the outside of the threads before you reinstall the fitting. *(Do not use TeflonÂ® tape.)* Make sure all parts are clean.  
- When you install a hose assembly, make sure it is not twisted when the fittings are tightened. Always use two wrenches on a swivel-type fittingâone to hold the fitting and the other to tighten the hose.  
- Keep the hose clamps tight to prevent the hoses from chafing and to avoid leaks.  
- Route hoses so they do not rub on sharp edges.  
- Thoroughly clean up any spilled hydraulic fluid.  
- Store and handle hydraulic fluid with care to prevent moisture and foreign matter from entering the hydraulic system.

1. Press the red **OFF ( O )** key on the keypad and disconnect the battery connector.  

   > â  **WARNING**  
   > Use extreme care whenever the truck is jacked up. Keep hands and feet clear from the vehicle while jacking the truck. After the truck is jacked, put solid blocks beneath it to support it. **DO NOT** rely on the jack alone to support the truck. For details, see *âJacking Safetyâ on page 2-9.*  

2. Jack and block the truck under the tractor frame.  
3. To separate the lift and carrier frames, remove all battery connections before removing the links.  
4. Remove the upper and lower linkages and lift the lift frame off the carrier frame. See **Figure 7-68**.

# Section 7. Component Procedures  
**Model 102XM Maintenance Manual**  

## Pallet Forks and Load Wheels  

### Downstops  
The **downstops** control the height of the fork heels above the floor when the truck is fully lowered. Downstop screws contact the fork frame arch to prevent the heels of the forks from coming too close to the floor.  

Excessive floor clearance may hinder pallet entry and exit.  

**NOTE:** Adjusting the downstops below the height specified in the adjustment procedure will not improve pallet entry or exit.  

### Lower Link and Pivot Block Inspection  
It is important to inspect the **lower links** and the **pivot block** on a regular basis (see *Scheduled Maintenance* for recommended intervals).  

**NOTE:** It is acceptable to have slight scuff marks at the fork heels and lower links. Any sign of metal removal indicates the downstops must be adjusted. If the lower links are worn even with the fork heel block, they must be replaced.  

Downstop adjustment after inspection is key in getting the maximum life from your truck.  

**Figure 7-69. Inspect these surfaces (truck lifted for clarity)**  

![Figure 7-69](image-placeholder)  

### Fork Heel Surface  
**Figure 7-70. Fork Heel Surface**  

![Figure 7-70](image-placeholder)  

**NOTE:** There should be **0.4 in. (10 mm)** of metal between the hole in the fork heel block and the edge of the fork heel. The lower links hang approximately **0.15 in. (4 mm)** below the fork heel. If the lower links are worn even with the fork heel block, they must be replaced.  

## Downstop Adjustment  
Adjustment of the downstops is necessary to accommodate drive tire and linkage wear. Correct adjustment will help to prevent excessive wear of the lower links and lower link pivot blocks.  

1. Park the truck on a smooth, level floor.  
2. Lower the forks completely.  
3. Turn the truck **OFF** and disconnect the battery connector.  
4. Remove the tractor covers.  
5. Verify that the downstop adjustment screws contact the fork frame arch, see **Figure 7-71**. If the screws do not contact the frame, loosen the lock nut then turn the adjustment screw out of the pivot frame.  

**NOTE:** Make sure there is sufficient thread engagement of the downstop adjustment screw in the pivot frame when adjustment is complete.

6. Measure the clearance of the fork heels from the floor. (Make sure to measure to the fork heel, not the lower link that hangs slightly below the fork heel.) Verify there is a clearance of **0.6 in. (15 mm)**. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the correct measurements are achieved.  

#### Figure 7-72. Correct Adjustment / Clearance  

**NOTE:** The top of the forks should be **3.25 in. (82.5 mm)** from the floor when the downstops are correctly adjusted.  

7. Reconnect the battery connector and press the green **ON ( | )** key on the keypad.  
8. Press the lift button to lift the fork frame.  

9. Hold the downstop screw in the correct adjustment position with an allen wrench and firmly tighten the lock nut.  

**NOTE:** Lock nuts that are not securely tightened will not hold the adjustment.  

10. Install the tractor covers.  
11. Test the truck for correct operation.  

**NOTE:** When downstop adjustment is performed, it is recommended to inspect the lower links and fork heels again in approximately one month.

### Skid Shoe Blocks  
Some trucks are supplied with **skid shoe blocks** to provide clearance from the floor to the bottom of the truck. If your truck is equipped with skid shoe blocks, they must be inspected for wear and adjusted to prevent wear of undercarriage components.  

### Skid Shoe Adjustment  
1. Lower the forks completely.  
2. Press the red **OFF ( O )** key on the keypad. Disconnect the battery connector.  
3. Jack and block the truck under the tractor frame.  
4. Adjust the skid blocks to the correct position.  
5. Apply thread-locking compound (**P/N 990-536**) to the mounting bolts.  
6. Torque the nut to **48 to 60 in. lbs. (5 to 7 Nm).**  

**Figure 7-73. Skid Blocks Installed**  

7. Worn skid blocks can be rotated **90 degrees** for additional life.

## Cold Storage Conditioning  

### Cold Storage Conditioning  

New *Raymond* Walkie Pallet Trucks supplied with a standard conditioning package are designed to operate in an environment where temperatures range from **32Â° to 104Â°F (0Â° to 40Â°C)** in a continuous duty cycle.  

Trucks supplied with a cold storage conditioning package are designed to operate to the following temperatures:  

- **5Â°F (-15Â°C)** in a continuous duty cycle (generally stored in freezers with short ambient temperature exposure).  
- **â13Â°F (â25Â°C)** for in and out operation (stored at ambient temperature with short trips in and out of the freezer condition).  

**NOTE:** Trucks ordered as cold storage from the factory are shipped with cold storage hydraulic fluid; there is no need to replace the fluid when installing the truck.  

### â  CAUTION  
When a truck is to be converted for use in a cold storage environment, change the fluid in the hydraulic reservoir referring to the recommendations on the Appendix.  

See **âLubrication Equivalency Chartâ on page A-2** for recommended fluids in the hydraulic reservoir and the drive unit.  

---

## Options  

### Cold Storage Hydraulic Fluid  

When changing from any other type of cold storage hydraulic fluid to fluid **P/N 1017238**:  

1. Drain the reservoir completely.  
2. Fill the reservoir with fluid.  
3. Install decal **P/N 1074515** on the hydraulic unit.  

### â  WARNING  
**Mixing with other types of cold storage fluids can cause âgellingâ of the fluid and lead to premature pump failure.**

# Section 8. Theory of Operation  
**Model 102XM Maintenance Manual**  

## Definitions  

### Acceleration  
The process where the truckâs acceleration characteristic is determined when the truck starts from a stop. This is a driver parameter (Acceleration). The range is from 30% to 90% in increments of 5%. Default is 80%. A lower number gives less aggressive acceleration.  

### Arm Angle Switches  
The Arm Angle Switches (S24 and S25) determine brake activation and truck travel speed. Each switch is activated by the control handle position. The control handle must be positioned between B1 and B2 of the operating range to permit travel. See **Figure 8-1**.  

When the control handle is in position **B1**, the parking brake engages. When the control handle is moved to position **T1**, the brake disengages, Arm Angle B switch (S25) closes and enables slow travel. See **Table 8-1**. When the control handle is placed in position **T2**, Arm Angle A switch (S24) also closes, enabling fast travel. When the control handle is placed in position **B2**, Arm Angle switch B opens, activating the parking brake.

### Click-to-Creep  
Click-to-creep enables creep speed travel with the control arm in the fully raised or lowered position: **â0â** disables the option and **â1â** enables the option. The default setting is **â0â**.  

Activate click-to-creep by quickly clicking the speed control in either direction twice with the tiller in the brake position. **âSLOâ** blinks on the display when in click-to-creep mode.  

Deactivate by clicking the speed control twice more. Click-to-creep mode deactivates automatically after **10 seconds** or immediately if the **Emergency Reverse (belly button) switch** is pushed.  

---

### Continuity  
A continuous and uninterrupted path between two or more locations in an electrical circuit, typically having a resistance of less than **1 ohm**.  

---

### Controller Area Network (CAN)  
Motor controller functions performed by the electronic circuitry (VM) and Traction Power Amplifier (TA) are communicated in the truck through this network.  

---

### Creep Speed  
Creep speed defines speed at low throttle positions. Creep speed range is adjustable from **â10 to 10**. The factory default value is **â5**. A negative number enhances low speed maneuverability. A positive number makes the truck more responsive.  

---

### Current Limiting  
A protective function of the traction power amplifier that prevents excessive current levels from damaging drive components.

# Model 102XM Maintenance Manual  
## Section 8. Theory of Operation  
### Definitions  

### Deceleration (Neutral Braking)  
A truck feature that provides some plugging effect when the throttle is returned to the neutral position. This is a Driver parameter (Deceleration). The range is from 40 to 90% in increments of 5%. Default is 65%. A lower number gives less aggressive braking. See [âProgramming Truck Parametersâ on page 3-7](#).  

### Emergency Reverse  
Emergency reverse function is activated when the brake is released, truck is ON, and the emergency reverse switch is pressed. After the switch is released, normal controller operation is not resumed until neutral (no direction) is selected and until the brake is cycled (brake applied, then brake released). However, repeatedly pressing the emergency reverse switch restarts the emergency reverse function each time.  

### Fault Codes  
The VM provides fault information by displaying fault codes on the LED display built into the control handle head. See the [âList of Messages and Codesâ on page 6-2](#) for a complete list of Caution and Error Codes. The TA provides fault information by flashing fault codes through two status LED indicators built into the TA cover.  

### High Pedal Disable (HPD)  
The HPD feature prevents the truck from traveling while the throttle is applied. The system is programmed to give the HPD warning if there is a throttle request before the key is turned ON or brake release input.  

### Open Circuit  
A lack of a continuous path between two or more electrical connections; usually greater than one megohm resistance.  

### Overvoltage Cutoff  
Occurs when there is very high voltage (greater than 34V) at the power amplifier B+ connection. Code C42 or E142 may be displayed and the truck must be restarted.  

### PIN-Key Code  
Trucks produced with a standard handle mounted keypad are protected from unauthorized operation by Personal Identification Number (PIN) keypad entry codes. Up to 10 operators can be assigned their own individual PIN-key code (of one to four digits) for access to the truck. Each operator can also set individual driver parameters. The default operator PIN-key code is number 1. See [âSetting Individual PIN-key Codesâ on page 3-9](#).  

### Pulse Width Modulation  
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), also called âchoppingâ, controls the speed of the motor by switching the battery voltage applied to the motor ON and OFF very quickly.  

### Regenerative Braking  
Regenerative Braking occurs when current, generated by the motor during plugging, is permitted to flow back into the batteries. Regenerative braking results in less motor heating. Regenerative braking also provides some return of energy to the battery pack.  

### Short Circuit or âShortâ  
A short circuit is an unspecified path in a circuit that provides unwanted full or partial continuity between two or more locations in an electrical circuit.  

**Example 1:** Two insulated wires are physically next to each other and the insulation has worn off each of the wires. Because the conductors are now touching each other, there is a short circuit.

# Section 8. Theory of Operation

## Definitions

**Example 2:** A power cable from the battery to a junction post in the truck has had the insulation worn away. Because the wire conductors are touching the tractor frame, there is a short circuit of the battery cable.

## Speed Limiting

The VM limits maximum speed:

- **âMax speed, Slow Modeâ** parameter determines the maximum speed value sent by the VM to the traction power amplifier (max. PWM) for the two directions of travel while in Slow speed mode. This is a programmable parameter.
- **âMax speed, Fast Modeâ** parameter determines the maximum speed value sent by the VM to the traction power amplifier (max. PWM) for the two directions of travel while in Fast speed mode. This is a programmable parameter.

## Static Return to Off (SRO)

The SRO feature prevents starting the truck (direction selected) prior to the release of the brake. SRO examines sequencing of the brake (deadman) switch input and key switch input relative to the direction input. The switch must be activated before the directional/speed control is rotated. If a direction is selected before or simultaneously (within 50 ms) with the brake input, the TA does not command travel.

## Thermal Cutback (Traction Power Amplifier)

Thermal cutback of the traction power amplifier occurs below â13Â°F (â25Â°C) or above 185Â°F (85Â°C). At 185 to 203Â°F (85 to 95Â°C), the drive current limit is linearly decreased from full set current down to zero. At â13 to â40Â°F (â25 to â40Â°C), the current limit is reduced to approx. half the set current, resulting in reduced travel speed. Below â40Â°F (â40Â°C) or above 203Â°F (95Â°C), the allowed travel speed is 0%. 

This function sets code **C43** on the display when a thermal cutback condition occurs. It may also be a factor when codes **C44** and **C46** occur.

## Tractor

The body section of the truck that contains the motors, drive unit, controls, and handle.

## Truck Off Delay (Keypad only)

Sets the truck OFF delay time (energy saving feature). If this time delay passes while the truck is in a brake position and the truck is idle (no inputs requested), the VM powers the truck OFF. 

This is a programmable Driver parameter setting that ranges from **0 to 20 minutes**. When the parameter is set to **0**, or the truck has the key switch option, the truck never powers OFF. See **âProgramming Truck Parametersâ on page 3-7**.

## Undervoltage Cutoff

Undervoltage protection automatically occurs when there is very low voltage (less than **13V**) at the traction power amplifier B+ connection. Code **C41** is displayed and the truck must be restarted.

## Vehicle Manager

Programmable motor control functions are performed by the electronic circuitry (VM) housed within the control handle. See **âVehicle Managerâ on page 8-6**.

### Truck Starting  

To start the truck, the battery is plugged in. This supplies battery positive and negative to the Traction Power Amplifier (TA) at the Bâ and B+ connections. Because the main contactor (K10) is still open, the B+ travels through the PTC R1 to the TA. This allows the internal capacitors of the TA to precharge. This voltage is also used by the TA at J5-16 to power the internal circuitry of the TA. The TA verifies the correct voltage is at the capacitors prior to closing the main contactor (K10). The Main ON/OFF switch is in the ON position, the PIN-key code is entered in the keypad, and the green ON ( | ) key pressed (or optional key switch is ON). The display will light.

## Traction System  

### Vehicle Manager  
The VM is also sometimes referred to as the Electronic Tiller Arm Card (ETAC). The programmable motor control functions are performed by the electronic circuitry housed within the VM in the control handle. The basic functions of the VM include:  

- Monitoring relative positioning of the thumb controls to eighteen hall effect sensors for speed and direction control.  
- Monitoring the position of the emergency reverse button for emergency reversing of the truck direction.  
- Monitoring truck performance and providing input data and commands to the operator display.  
- Providing lift/lower input commands to the power amplifier.  
- Monitoring horn switches S18-1 and S18-2 for horn operation.  
- Monitoring and defining truck performance parameters.  

### Power Amplifier  
The basic functions of the power amplifier include:  

- The direction control section that controls the traction motor direction by manipulating the traction motor field polarity according to the directional inputs from the VM.  
- The speed control section that controls the traction motor speed and torque by monitoring the position change of the Arm Angle A and Arm Angle B switches. Variable motor speed is accomplished by separate control of field and armature currents.  
- The control circuit section that controls all truck inputs and outputs (excluding handle head inputs).  

---

## Direction/Speed Control  
The following descriptions assume the battery is charged and connected, and the truck is ON.  

### Control Handle Positioning  
- When the control handle is in the upright position, the parking brake is engaged.  
- When the control handle is within 5 to 30 degrees of the upright position, Arm Angle B Switch (S25) closes and enables slow speed travel, the main contactor closes, and the brake is allowed to disengage (when travel is requested).  
- When the control handle is placed beyond 30 degrees from the top, Arm Angle A Switch (S24) also closes, enabling fast speed operation.  
- When the control handle is placed in the bottom 5 degrees of its operating range, Arm Angle B Switch opens, engaging the parking brake.  
- When the control handle is returned to the full upright position, the main contactor remains closed for approximately 20 seconds then opens.  

### Travel Request  
When the thumb controls are rotated from neutral:  

- A forward travel signal is detected via hall effect sensors, by the Vehicle Manager (VM). The VM determines if the request is for forward (tractor-first) direction or reverse (forks-first) direction based on which set of hall effect sensors are activated.  
- The VM verifies that the emergency reverse button is not activated.  
- The VM verifies the state of both switch S24 (Arm Angle A) and switch S25 (Arm Angle B) via a CAN message from the TA. Based on their position, the VM sends the travel request via the CAN to the TA.  
- If the main contactor (K10) is not closed, the TA supplies Bâ to pin J5-4, closing the K10 contactor and the K4 MCR (Master Control Relay).  
- The TA releases the brake.

# Model 102XM Maintenance Manual  
## Section 8. Theory of Operation  
### Traction System  

- The TA then controls the voltage at Mâ for the traction motor armature and F1, F2 for the traction motor field. Voltage to the traction motor armature varies from approximately 24V (0 mph) to approximately 1.5V (full speed). Voltage to the traction motor field is about 7.6 volts, depending on travel direction. The TA alternates the direction of current flow between F1 and F2 depending on travel direction request.  
- The drive wheel starts to rotate in the requested direction. During travel, the TA monitors armature and field current and limits it as required.  

### Emergency Reverse  

If the emergency reverse button (belly button) hall effect switch is closed with the control handle lowered in travel mode (SW2 closed), the control system activates an immediate, rapid acceleration in the reverse (forks-first) direction. The following occurs:  

- The emergency reverse travel instruction is transmitted through the CAN-bus to the TA.  
- Travel and speed inputs to the TA are ignored.  
- The TA provides maximum torque inputs to the TM immediately after the emergency reverse button is activated.  
- Travel in reverse (forks-first) direction continues until the emergency reverse button is released.  

When the emergency reverse mode is activated, the TA ceases to respond to the normal travel command from the directional/speed control. To reset the truck for normal travel, return the directional/speed control to the neutral position and cycle the brake ON/OFF.  

### Electric Brake Release Switch  

If the Master Control Relay (K4) cannot be closed by the TA, an option for releasing the brake is available. A manually activated Electric Brake Release Switch (S20) and Electric Brake Release Relay (K5) have been added.  

S20 and K5 are supplied Bâ at S20-8 and K5-1 any time the battery is plugged in. K5-2 and S25 are supplied with B+ from fuse F50 any time the battery is plugged in. To release the brake, S20 must be closed, completing a path between K5-4 and the brake coil. S20 also completes a path between Bâ at S20-8 and the negative side of the brake coil.  

When the handle is moved down and S25 closes, B+ is supplied to K5-2, closing the K5 relay tips. With the tips closed, B+ is supplied from K5-4 through S20 to the positive side of the brake coil, releasing the brake.  

When the control handle is moved to the full up position and S20 is still activated, S25 opens. The K5 relay also opens removing B+ from the brake coil. When this happens, the transient voltage created from the brake coil collapsing travels from the positive side of the coil through S20-7 to S20-2 to the top of the zener diode. The voltage created is higher than battery voltage and reverse biases the diode, allowing flow through the diode, through S20-8 and S20-4 to the negative side of the brake coil, allowing the voltage to dissipate.

# Section 8. Theory of Operation  
## Lift/Lower System  

The lift/lower system consists of an electrically operated hydraulic pump assembly and related components.  

The hydraulic pump assembly consists of a positive displacement rotary gear pump with a reservoir mounted to an adapter. A DC electric motor is mounted to the opposite side of the pump adapter. An adjustable relief valve, check valve, and a solenoid-operated load holding valve are installed within the adapter.  

With the forks elevated, the normally closed solenoid valve and the check valve prevent hydraulic fluid from returning to the reservoir.  

### Lift  

When the battery is connected, the truck is ON, and the lift button is pressed:  

- A lift request is detected by the VM via hall effect sensors. The VM checks the status of the lift-limit switch (S36) to make sure it is open. The VM also checks the battery state-of-charge to verify lift is still allowed. The request for lift is then converted into a CAN message and sent to the Traction Power Amplifier.  
- The TA checks the state of the Main Contactor (K10) and closes it if required.  
- The TA supplies B- to the lift pump contactor (K30) and it closes, applying B+ to the lift pump motor (M3).  
- Hydraulic fluid is drawn into the lift pump.  
- As the pump rotates, oil is forced out the pressure port through the lift hose to the lift cylinder. Oil cannot return to the reservoir because of the closed check valve and closed load holding solenoid valve.  
- Hydraulic pressure in the lift cylinder lifts the forks.  
- The relief valve opens if the hydraulic pressure exceeds the preset limit while lifting.  

Once maximum lift is reached, the lift-limit switch (S36) opens, removing B+ from pin J5-15. Loss of the B+ voltage tells the TA to remove the B- voltage supplied to the lift contactor (K30).  

When the lift button is released:  

- The pump contactor coil (K30) is de-energized. This stops the lift motor and pump. The forks are held in position by hydraulic fluid trapped in the cylinder by the check valve and the closed load holding solenoid valve (Y10).  

### Lower  

When the battery is connected, the truck is ON, and the lower button is pressed:  

- A lower request is detected by the VM via hall effect sensors. The request for lower is converted into a CAN message and sent to the TA.  
- Load holding solenoid valve (Y10) opens.  
- Hydraulic fluid in the lift cylinder returns to the hydraulic reservoir through the load holding valve and the flow control valve. The lowering speed is regulated by the flow control valve.  
- The forks lower.
