## **Important!!!**  
### **Before You Install**

1. **Inspect the Lift:**  
   Before installing your Challenger 2-Post lift, inspect the lift to ensure that it is complete and undamaged. Challenger 2-Post lifts are shipped ready to assemble to facilitate shipping and reduce damage. If it is apparent that the lift has been mishandled in shipment, or if parts or assemblies are missing, note the damage or missing part(s) on the shipping papers and notify **Challenger Lifts, Inc.** immediately.

2. **Check Electrical Requirements:**  
   Be certain that the wiring in your building will handle the current required to operate this unit. It requires a **Dedicated 25 Amp Circuit**.

3. **Verify Concrete Floor Requirements:**  
   Be certain that you have the proper concrete floor to properly handle the loaded lift. The floor should be in generally good condition with no large cracks, spalling, or deterioration.  
   - The **minimum requirements** for concrete are **4 inches minimum depth, with steel reinforcement, 3500 PSI, cured for a minimum of 28 days**.  
   - The floor should be **level within 3/8 inch** over the installation area.  
   - No anchors should be installed **within 8 inches** of any crack, edge, or expansion joint.  
   - If these conditions cannot be met, **pads can be poured** to accommodate the lift.

4. **Check Local Regulations:**  
   Check with the local building inspectors and/or permits office for any special instructions or approvals required for your installation.

## Installation, Operation and Maintenance  

## Installation Procedure  

1. Break down the packaging with the columns by supporting the upper column and using a 3/4" wrench, remove the bolts at the top and bottom of the column. Carefully remove the top cap that is used for shipping and hold the overhead support plate in position. Use the bolts that held the top cap to bolt the support in place. You may wish to only snug the bolts in place so the support can be moved slightly to align the overhead.  

2. Layout the service bay according to the architect’s plans or owner’s instructions (**See Figures 1 & 1A**). Be certain that the proper conditions exist per the section entitled “Before You Install”.  

   2A. Erect both column assemblies, spacing them as shown in **Figure 1A**. Align the columns with the installation lines (**See Figure 1A**) and drill the holes for the anchors using the base plate as a template. Clean the dust from the holes. Obtain the anchor bolts from the hardware box and assemble the nut and washer to the bolt, leaving about 1/4" of thread above the nut. Insert the anchors into each hole as it is drilled and tap it down to the base plate. If the floor is excessively uneven, you may wish to leave more thread exposed.

**CAUTION!!!** If the lift is not installed in this manner, the arms may damage the power unit during operation.  
**See Fig 2.**  

![Fig 2](#)  

### 4. Shim Both Columns  
Shim both columns to plumb using the shims provided. Do not shim more than ½” at any given point. Use a level no less than 24” in length to plumb the columns.  

**IMPORTANT:** Insure to shim under not only anchor bolts but also, cylinder and column too as shown in **Fig 3**. Failure to do so may cause premature wear and/or lift to work improperly and void warranty.  

![Fig 3](#)  

### 5. Anchor Bolts  
Back the nuts on the anchors up until the threads are flush with the top of the nut and tap them down against the base plate. Using a torque wrench, tighten the anchors to 150 ft/lbs to set the anchors. Check the columns for plumb after torquing the bolts and adjust by shimming if necessary.  

### 6. Synchronizer Cable Assembly  
Assemble the synchronizer cable sheaves, axles, and spacers in the overhead channel.  
**See Figure 4.**  

![Fig 4](#)  

### 7. Overhead Support Clips  
Attach the overhead support clips to the columns. Set the overhead channel in the columns onto the support clips. Fasten channel using the 3/8” bolts, nuts, and washers.

- Establish procedures to periodically inspect the lift in accordance with the lift manufacturer’s instructions or **ANSI/ALI ALOIM-1994**, *American National Standard for Automotive Lifts - Safety Requirements for Operation, Inspection and Maintenance*; and ensure that the lift inspectors are qualified and adequately trained in the inspection of the lift.  

- Establish procedures to periodically maintain the lift in accordance with the lift manufacturer’s instructions or **ANSI/ALI ALOIM-1994**, *American National Standard for Automotive Lifts - Safety Requirements for Operation, Inspection and Maintenance*; and ensure that the lift maintenance personnel are qualified and adequately trained in the maintenance of the lift.  

- Maintain the periodic inspection and maintenance records recommended by the manufacturer or **ANSI/ALI ALOIM-1994**, *American National Standard for Automotive Lifts - Safety Requirements for Operation, Inspection and Maintenance*.  

- Display the lift manufacturer’s operating instructions:  
  - **ALI/SM 93-1**, *ALI Lifting it Right* safety manual  
  - **ALI/ST-90**, *ALI Safety Tips* card  
  - **ANSI/ALI ALOIM-1994**, *American National Standard for Automotive Lifts - Safety Requirements for Operation, Inspection and Maintenance*  
  - In the case of frame engaging lifts: **ALI/LP-GUIDE**, *Vehicle Lifting Points/Quick Reference Guide for Frame Engaging Lifts*  
  - These should be placed in a conspicuous location in the lift area convenient to the operator.  

## Lifting a Vehicle  

1. Ensure that the lifting arms are parked, out of the way of the vehicle.  
2. Position the vehicle in the service bay so that:  
   - The vehicle’s center of gravity is on or slightly behind a line between the two columns.  
   - The vehicle is centered between the two columns.  
   - The short extension arms are placed at the vehicle’s front lifting points.  
   - The long extension arms are placed at the rear lifting points.  

**Do not place the vehicle in the service bay backwards.**  

**Do not attempt to lift the vehicle with only two arms, as this will void the warranty.**  

3. Refer to the vehicle manufacturer’s service manual, technical bulletins, or other publications to locate the recommended lifting points.  
4. Position the arms so that all four pads contact the vehicle simultaneously.  

**The vehicle should remain level during lifting.**  

5. Raise the lift until all four wheels are off the ground. Test the stability of the vehicle by attempting to rock the car.  
   - If the vehicle seems unstable, lower the lift and readjust the arms.  
   - If the vehicle is stable, raise the vehicle to a height a few inches above the desired working height.  

6. When the vehicle has reached the desired working height:  
   - Release the power pack button.  
   - Lower the vehicle until the safety latches on both columns engage.  
   - The vehicle should remain level when both latches are engaged.  
   - If one side engages and the other continues to descend, stop lowering the vehicle, raise it several inches, and try again to engage both latches.

- Raise the vehicle until both latches are free.  
- Disengage the latches by depressing the palm button and holding it.  
- Lower the vehicle by depressing the lowering valve handle.  
- Continue to lower the vehicle until the carriages stop against the base plate. Retract the extension arms, and park them. It is important to fully lower the lift to release hydraulic pressure on the system.  

---

## Maintenance  
The following maintenance points are suggested as the basis of a preventive maintenance program. The actual maintenance program should be tailored to the installation.  

### **Daily**  
- Inspect the lift for loose anchor bolts (If loose, tighten to 80 ft-lbs).  
- **All anchor bolts should take full torque.**  
- Check for fluid leaks and loose connections.  
- Check for broken parts.  

### **Weekly**  
- Check fluid level in power pack reservoir.  
- Check for lock release activation.  

### **Monthly**  
- Check synchronizer cables for wear and tension, adjust if necessary.  
- Lubricate cable sheaves or chain sprockets with light oil to reduce drag.  
- Lubricate carriage slide tracks with heavy viscous grease.

## Appendix A  
### **Hydraulic Fitting Assembly**  
Hydraulic line sets are prefabricated to allow easy assembly in the field. Follow the steps outlined below for a reliable, leak-free joint:  

1. Remove any shipping plugs or caps, ensuring that no remnants of the plugs or caps remain in the tube.  
2. Lubricate the threads and seat of the fitting with hydraulic oil or a compatible lubricant.  
   - **Do not use pipe dope or Teflon tape on these fittings.**  
3. Align the tubing joints so that the tubing and sleeve assemblies can be inserted easily into the fitting.  
4. Insert the tubing and sleeve assemblies into the fitting and start the fitting nut by hand.  

   **CAUTION:** *If the fitting nut cannot be started by hand, the joint is not aligned properly. Attempting to start a misaligned fitting with a wrench is likely to damage the fitting and result in a leaking joint.*  

5. Tighten the fitting nut until the force required to turn it rises sharply.  
6. Tighten the fitting nut **1/4 turn past** the point noted in the previous step. Only if the joint leaks in operation should the joint be tightened further.  

   **CAUTION:** *Do not over tighten the hydraulic fittings.*

## Installation, Operation and Maintenance  

## Appendix B  

### Anchor Bolt Installation  

- Insure the concrete has had sufficient time to cure - **28 days minimum**.  
- Always wear safety glasses.  
- Follow the drill manufacturer's safety instructions.  
- Use only solid carbide-tipped drill bits meeting **ANSI B94** tip diameter standards.  
- Drill the anchor bolt holes **perpendicular** to the work surface. To assure full holding power, do not ream the hole or allow the drill to wobble.  
- Drill the hole at least as deep as the full length of the anchor, completely through the slab if possible.  
- Clean the hole, using compressed air and a wire brush. A clean hole is necessary for proper performance.  
- Assemble the washer and nut on the anchor bolt so that the anchor protrudes slightly beyond the nut.  
- **The anchor should drop easily into the hole, requiring no more than a slight tap to seat it fully.**  
- Tap the anchor through the fixture (lift base plate) and into the hole, making sure that the nut rests solidly against the fixture.  
- Tighten the nut to **150 ft-lbs** for **3/4 inch** diameter bolts and to **75 ft-lbs** for **3/8 inch** diameter bolts.
