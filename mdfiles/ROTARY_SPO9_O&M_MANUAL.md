# LIFT LOCKOUT/TAGOUT PROCEDURE

## Purpose
This procedure establishes the minimum requirements for the lockout of energy that could cause injury to personnel by the operation of lifts in need of repair or being serviced. All employees shall comply with this procedure.

## Responsibility
The responsibility for assuring that this procedure is followed is binding upon all employees and service personnel from outside service companies (i.e., Authorized Rotary Installers, contactors, etc.). All employees shall be instructed in the safety significance of the lockout procedure by the facility owner/manager. Each new or transferred employee along with visiting outside service personnel shall be instructed by the owner/manager (or assigned designee) in the purpose and use of the lockout procedure.

## Preparation
Employees authorized to perform lockout shall ensure that the appropriate energy isolating device (i.e., circuit breaker, fuse, disconnect, etc.) is identified for the lift being locked out. Other such devices for other equipment may be located in close proximity of the appropriate energy isolating device. If the identity of the device is in question, see the shop supervisor for resolution. Assure that proper authorization is received prior to performing the lockout procedure.

## Sequence of Lockout Procedure
1. Notify all affected employees that a lockout is being performed and the reason for it.
2. Unload the subject lift. Shut it down and assure the disconnect switch is **“OFF”** if one is provided on the lift.
3. The authorized lockout person operates the main energy isolation device removing power to the subject lift.
   - If this is a lockable device, the authorized lockout person places the assigned padlock on the device to prevent its unintentional reactivation. An appropriate tag is applied stating the person’s name, at least **3”x 6” (76 x 152mm)** in size, an easily noticeable color, and states not to operate device or remove tag.
   - If this device is a non-lockable circuit breaker or fuse, replace with a **“dummy”** device and tag it appropriately as mentioned above.
4. Attempt to operate lift to assure the lockout is working. Be sure to return any switches to the **“OFF”** position.
5. The equipment is now locked out and ready for the required maintenance or service.

## Restoring Equipment to Service
1. Assure the work on the lift is complete and the area is clear of tools, vehicles, and personnel.
2. At this point, the authorized person can remove the lock (or dummy circuit breaker or fuse) & tag and activate the energy isolating device so that the lift may again be placed into operation.

## Rules for Using Lockout Procedure
Use the Lockout Procedure whenever the lift is being repaired or serviced, waiting for repair when current operation could cause possible injury to personnel, or for any other situation when unintentional operation could injure personnel. No attempt shall be made to operate the lift when the energy isolating device is locked out.

# PROCEDIMIENTO DE BLOQUEO/ETIQUETADO DEL ELEVADOR

## Propósito
Este procedimiento establece los requerimientos mínimos para el corte de la alimentación de elevadores que necesitan reparación y que podrían provocar daños al personal que lo opera. Todos los empleados deben cumplir este procedimiento.

## Responsabilidad
La responsabilidad de asegurar que este procedimiento se cumpla recae sobre todos los empleados y el personal de servicio externo a la compañía (ejemplo: Instaladores Autorizados de Rotary, contratistas, etc.). Todos los empleados deben recibir capacitación por parte del propietario/administrador sobre la importancia del procedimiento de seguridad de bloqueo. Todo empleado nuevo o transferido, así como también el personal de servicio externo deben recibir capacitación por parte del propietario/administrador (o persona designada) con el objetivo de saber cómo utilizar el procedimiento de bloqueo.

## Preparación
Los empleados autorizados para llevar a cabo el bloqueo deben asegurarse de que el dispositivo de aislamiento de energía apropiado (i.e., interruptor automático, fusible, desconectivo, etc.) esté identificado para que el elevador sea bloqueado. Los dispositivos similares para otros equipos deben estar ubicados en la cercanía del dispositivo de aislamiento de energía apropiado. Si la identidad del dispositivo está en duda, contacte al supervisor del taller para obtener una solución. Asegúrese de obtener la autorización necesaria antes de ejecutar el procedimiento de bloqueo.

## Pasos del Procedimiento de Bloqueo
1. Notifique a todos los empleados afectados que un bloqueo está realizándose y la razón de él.
2. Descargue el elevador en cuestión. Apáguelo y asegúrese de que, si existe un interruptor de desconexión en el elevador, esté en “APAGADO”.
3. La persona autorizada para realizar el bloqueo será la encargada de cortar la corriente utilizando el dispositivo de aislamiento de energía para el elevador en cuestión.
   - Si éste es un dispositivo bloqueable, la persona de bloqueo autorizada coloca el candado asignado sobre el dispositivo para prevenir su reactivación no intencional. Una etiqueta apropiada es aplicada mencionando el nombre de la persona, de al menos 3” x 6” (76 X 152 MM) de tamaño, en un color fácil de notarse, y expresa no operar el dispositivo o quitar la etiqueta.
   - Si el dispositivo es un interruptor de circuito o fusible y no se puede bloquear, reemplácelo por un dispositivo “falso” y etiquételo apropiadamente del mismo modo que se mencionó arriba.
4. Intente operar el elevador para asegurar que el bloqueo está funcionando. Asegúrese de colocar todos los interruptores en la posición “APAGADO”.
5. El equipo está ahora bloqueado y listo para el mantenimiento o servicio requerido.

## Restablecimiento del Equipo al Servicio
1. Asegúrese de que el trabajo en el elevador esté completo y el área libre de herramientas, vehículos y personal.
2. En este punto, la persona autorizada puede remover el candado (o falso circuito de interrupción o fusible) y etiqueta y activar el dispositivo de aislamiento de energía para que el elevador pueda ser nuevamente puesto en operación.

## Reglas para utilizar el Procedimiento de Bloqueo
Utilice el Procedimiento de Bloqueo cuando el elevador sea reparado o necesite servicio, esté esperando por reparación o cuando su operación actual pueda provocar daños al personal, o por cualquier otra situación cuando su operación no intencional pudiera causar daños al personal. No debe intentar operar el elevador cuando el dispositivo de aislamiento de energía esté bloqueado.

Chaque employé ainsi que le personnel de réparation envoyé par des sociétés externes (c.-à-d. installateurs agréés de Rotary, entrepreneurs, etc.) sont tenus de respecter cette procédure. Tous les employés doivent avoir reçu du propriétaire/directeur de l'installation des indications sur la signification de sécurité de la procédure de verrouillage. Chaque nouvel employé ou employé transféré ainsi que la visite du personnel de service venant de l'extérieur devra être instruit par le propriétaire/gestionnaire (ou délégué assigné) dans le but et l'utilisation de la procédure de verrouillage.

## Préparation

Les employés autorisés à effectuer le verrouillage doivent assurer qu'un dispositif d'isolation d’énergie approprié (i.e. disjoncteur, fusible, sectionneur, etc.) est identifié pour le verrouillage de l’élévateur. D'autres dispositifs de ce genre pour d'autres équipements peuvent être situés à proximité du dispositif approprié d'isolement de l'énergie. Si l'identité du dispositif n'est pas claire, voir le directeur d'atelier pour résoudre ce problème. Assurez-vous que les autorisations correctes sont reçues avant d’entreprendre la procédure de verrouillage.

## Déroulement de la procédure de verrouillage

1. Notifiez tous les employés affectés qu'un verrouillage va avoir lieu et expliquez la raison.
2. Déchargez l’élévateur en question. Arrêtez l’élévateur et vérifiez que l’interrupteur est sur « OFF » s’il y en a un sur l’élévateur.
3. La personne autorisée au verrouillage fait fonctionner le dispositif d'isolement d'énergie principal, ce qui met l’élévateur en question hors tension.
   - Si c'est un dispositif verrouillable, la personne autorisée pour le verrouillage place le cadenas désigné sur le dispositif afin d'empêcher sa réactivation involontaire. Une étiquette appropriée sera adjointe, indiquant le nom de la personne, de dimension d’au moins 3”x 6” (76 x 152mm), de couleur facilement repérable, et signalant de ne pas faire fonctionner le dispositif ni retirer l'étiquette.
   - Si ce dispositif est un disjoncteur ou un fusible impossible à verrouiller, remplacez par un appareil « fantôme » et étiquetez comme il est expliqué ci-dessus.
4. Essayez de faire fonctionner l’élévateur pour vous assurer que le verrouillage fonctionne. Ne pas oublier de remettre tous les interrupteurs sur la position « OFF ».
5. L’équipement est à présent verrouillé et prêt pour l’entretien ou les réparations requis.

## Remise en service de l'équipement

1. Assurez-vous que le travail sur l’élévateur est terminé et que la zone est libre d'outils, de véhicules et de personnel.
2. La personne autorisée peut maintenant déverrouiller (le disjoncteur ou fusible provisoire) et retirer l'étiquette, puis activer le dispositif d'isolation d'énergie afin que l'élévateur puisse être remis en fonction.

## Règles d'utilisation de la procédure de verrouillage

Utiliser la procédure de verrouillage pour effectuer une réparation ou une manipulation d’entretien, et attendre avant d’effectuer la réparation si une manipulation dans l’immédiat peut engendrer un risque de blessure ou dans toute situation où une manipulation involontaire peut blesser des personnes. Aucune tentative de fonctionnement de l’élévateur ne doit être accomplie lorsque le dispositif d'isolation d’énergie est verrouillé.
