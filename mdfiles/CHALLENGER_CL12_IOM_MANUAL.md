50) Start with Idler side first. Slowly and carefully loosen the bleed plug on top of the cylinder just enough to allow the entrapped air to escape. Repeat for power side.  
51) Raise lift 6 inches. Repeat step 47 until no air comes out of cylinder.  
52) Pressure test hydraulic system. Energize power unit, raise lift to full rise and continue to run motor for additional 10 seconds. **(NOTE: pressure relief will make a high pitch squeal sound for these 10 seconds.)** Check hydraulic system for leaks.  
53) Energize power unit again for 10 seconds. With a clean rag, wipe down both cylinder rods. *(The cylinders are shipped with a small amount of clear anti-corrosive lubricant that will be forced out through the wiper when the lift reaches full rise.)* **If lubricant is not wiped clean from the cylinder rod, the cylinder will appear to be leaking.**  

### SYNCHRONIZING CABLES  
54) Raise lift and ensure carriages lower into same lock position.  
55) Adjust synchronizing cables so the tension is equal in both cables and carriages are firmly sitting on locks.  
56) Cycle lift to ensure that latches operate simultaneously. Adjust if necessary.  

### LOCK RELEASE  
57) Raise lift and ensure carriages lower into same lock position.  
58) Adjust synchronizing cables so the tension is equal in both cables and carriages are firmly sitting on locks.  

### ARM PIN KEEPER INSTALL  
59) Install the arm pin into the arm assembly and carriage.  
60) Raise lift high enough to gain access underneath the carriage. **Make Sure Lift Is In Locks Before Proceeding.**  
61) Slide the provided washer onto pin up against the inner bevel gear.  
62) Install the provided retaining ring onto the pin with tool, **Fig 24**.  

![Fig 24 – Arm Pin Keeper Install](#)  

## FINAL CHECKOUT PROCEDURE  
63) Demonstrate the operation of the lift to the owner/operator/employer using a typical vehicle and review correct and safe lifting procedures using the *Lifting It Right* booklet as a guide.  
64) Return all provided literature (including this manual) to the literature pack envelope and deliver the envelope to the owner/operator/employer.

# Model CL12 Installation, Operation and Maintenance

## LIFTING A VEHICLE

1) Ensure that the lifting arms are parked, out to full drive-thru position.  
2) Center the vehicle between the columns in the service bay and position the vehicle’s center of gravity midpoint between the columns.  
   **NOTE:** The center of gravity is based on the weight distribution and is not the same as the center point of the vehicle.  

   **DO NOT EXCEED 3000 POUNDS PER ARM.**  
   **DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LIFT THE VEHICLE WITH ONLY TWO ARMS, AS THIS WILL VOID THE WARRANTY.**  
   **ENSURE THAT THE HIGHEST POINT ON THE VEHICLE WILL CONTACT THE OVERHEAD LIMIT SWITCH BAR.**  
   **DO NOT PLACE THE VEHICLE IN THE SERVICE BAY BACKWARDS.**  

   **REFER TO THE VEHICLE MANUFACTURER'S SERVICE MANUAL, TECHNICAL BULLETINS, “VEHICLE LIFTING POINTS GUIDE” (ALI/LP-GUIDE) OR OTHER PUBLICATIONS TO LOCATE THE RECOMMENDED LIFTING POINTS.**  

3) Position the arms and adapters so all four pads contact the vehicle simultaneously.  
   The vehicle should remain level during lifting.  
4) Raise the lift until all four wheels are off the ground. Test the stability of the vehicle by attempting to rock the vehicle. Check adapters for secure contact with vehicle lift points. If the vehicle seems unstable, lower the lift and readjust the arms. If the vehicle is stable, raise the vehicle to a height a few inches above the desired working height.  
5) Lower the vehicle until the safety latches on both columns engage. The vehicle should remain level when both latches are engaged. If one side engages and the other continues to descend, stop lowering the vehicle, raise it several inches, and try again to engage both latches.  

   **Always lower lift into locks before entering the area beneath the vehicle.**  
   **Always use safety stands when removing or installing heavy components.**  

## LOWERING A VEHICLE

1) Ensure that the area under the vehicle is clear of personnel and tools.  
2) Raise the vehicle until both latches are free.  
3) Disengage the locks by pulling down on the lock release lever.  
4) Lower the vehicle by depressing the lowering valve handle.  
5) Continue to lower the vehicle until the carriages stop against the base plate. Retract the extension arms, and park them.  

## LOSS OF POWER

If for any reason the lift will not raise off of the locks or the locks will not retract, consult factory-authorized personnel.  

**DO NOT OVERRIDE ANY SAFETY FEATURE IN AN ATTEMPT TO LOWER THE LIFT.**  

## MAINTENANCE

To avoid personal injury, permit only qualified personnel to perform maintenance on this equipment. Maintenance personnel should follow lockout/tagout instructions per ANSI Z244.1.  

The following maintenance points are suggested as the basis of a routine maintenance program. The actual maintenance program should be tailored to the installation. See ANSI/ALI ALOIM booklet for periodic inspection checklist and maintenance log sheet.  

- If lift stops short of full rise or chatters, check fluid level and bleed both cylinders per Installation Instructions.  
- **Replace all Safety, Warning, or Caution Labels if missing or damaged** (See **Installation instructions page 3**.)  

### Daily  
- Keep lift components clean.  
- Check for loose or broken parts.  
- Check hydraulic system for fluid leaks.  
- Check adapters for damage or excessive wear. Replace as required with genuine Challenger Lifts parts.  
- Check the lock release activation. When properly adjusted, both locks should be in a vertical position when the lock release lever is pulled and should return to an engagement position when the lever is released.  

### Weekly  
- Check synchronizer cables and sheaves for wear. Replace as required with genuine Challenger Lifts parts.  
- Check synchronizer cable tension per Installation Instructions. Adjust if necessary.  

### Monthly  
- Torque concrete anchor bolts to 80 ft-lbs.  
- Visually inspect concrete floor for cracks and/or sprawls within 12” of base plate.  
- Check overhead shutoff switch. While raising lift, operate overhead shutoff bar. Power Unit motor should stop when bar is raised.  
- Lubricate carriage slide tracks with heavy viscous grease. (Grease all (4) corners of both columns.)  

**If any problems are encountered, contact your local service representative.**
