## SECTION 1. WARNINGS  

---

### ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️  
### FIRE OR EXPLOSION HAZARD  
*Can cause death, severe injury or property damage.*  

1. Read this manual carefully before installing or servicing this equipment. Improper installation, service, or maintenance can cause death, injury, or property damage.  
2. Check clearances given on the outside of each burner to make sure the product is suitable for your application.  
3. Installer must be a trained, experienced service technician or representative.  
4. All service must be performed only by a trained service technician or representative.  
5. After installation is complete, check product operation as provided in these instructions.  

#### **Combustibles:**  
Failure to maintain the specified minimum clearances to combustibles could result in a serious fire hazard. Do not locate flammable or combustible materials within this distance. Signs should be posted in storage areas to specify maximum stacking height to maintain required clearances to combustibles. Do not locate in hazardous atmospheres containing flammable vapors or combustible dust.  

- **United States:** Installations in public garages or airplane hangars are permitted when in accordance with ANSI Z83.6 and NFPA-409 and 88 Codes.  
- **Canada:** Installation in public garages is permitted when in accordance with CAN/CGA B.149.1 or .2. Installation in airplane hangars is permitted when in accordance with the requirements of the enforcing agency.  

#### **Vehicles:**  
Minimum clearances must be maintained from vehicles parked below the heater. Ensure that adequate clearance is maintained where vehicle lifts are in operation.  

#### **Gas Connection:**  
There is an expansion of the radiant pipe with each firing cycle, and this will cause the burner to move with respect to the gas line. This can cause a gas leak resulting in an unsafe condition if the gas connection is not made strictly in accordance with Figure 24 of these instructions.  

#### **Ignition:**  
This appliance does not have a pilot. It is equipped with an ignition device which automatically lights the burner. Do not try to light the burner by hand.  

#### **Mechanical Hazard—Suspension:**  
Use appropriate suspension hardware, beam clamps (rod or perforated strap), and turnbuckles at predetermined locations. The weight and normal movement of the heating system may cause support failure if the following minimum suspension requirements are not met:  

- Distance between supports must be **10 ft. (3 m) or less**  
- Chain size must be **2/0 minimum or equivalent**  

Failure of the supports can cause property damage, severe injury, or death.  

---

### 🔹 IMPORTANT  
**Failure to follow these instructions can cause personal injury or property damage:**  

- Do not use in an atmosphere containing halogenated hydrocarbons or other corrosive chemicals. Some compounds in the air can be drawn into the equipment and can cause an accelerated rate of corrosion of some parts of the heat exchanger. The use of such chemical compounds in or near the enclosure should be avoided where a longer life of the burner, tubing, and other parts is desirable.  
- Caution should be used when running the system near combustible materials such as wood, paper, rubber, etc. Consideration should be given to partitions, storage racks, hoists, building construction, etc. Figure 1 gives minimum acceptable clearances to combustibles.  
- If the building has a slight negative pressure or contaminants are present in the air, an outside combustion air supply to the heaters is strongly recommended.  

---

### ⚠️ CAUTION  
**Failure to follow these instructions can cause damage to the system components:**  

- Do not high-pressure test the gas piping with the burners connected. Failure to follow this procedure will exceed the pressure rating of burner gas controls and this will require complete replacement of these parts.  
- This heater is designed for heating nonresidential indoor spaces. These instructions, the layout drawing, local codes and ordinances, and applicable standards that apply to gas piping, electrical wiring, venting, etc., must be thoroughly understood before proceeding with the installation.

# VANTAGE INSTALLATION MANUAL  
**ROBERTS-GORDON**  

## ► Section 2. Introduction  

Roberts-Gordon pioneered low-intensity infrared heating systems in 1962 with the introduction of its revolutionary custom-engineered Co-Ray-Vac® system. Now Roberts-Gordon offers over 30 years of infrared expertise in a unitary heating system. The Vantage II (CTH2) is a low-cost, non-condensing, field-assembled unitary heating system that is easy to install and requires only minimal maintenance. It is designed to provide years of economical operation and trouble-free service.  

### Checking Shipment  

Check the shipment against the Bill of Lading for shortages. Also, check for external damage to cartons. Note any shortages and/or external damage to cartons on the Bill of Lading in the presence of the carrier. The carrier should acknowledge any shortages or damage by initialing this “noted” Bill of Lading. Immediately report any claims for damaged material, or shortages that were not evident at the time of shipment, to the carrier and your Roberts-Gordon Factory Representative.  

### Installer Responsibility  

All heaters and associated gas piping should be installed in accordance with applicable specifications, and this installation should be made only by firms (or individuals) well qualified in this type of work. Consult local building inspectors, Fire Marshals, or your local Roberts-Gordon Representative for guidance.  

Vantage II heaters are installed based on information given in a layout drawing, which, together with the cited codes and regulations, comprise the basic information needed to complete the installation. The installer must furnish all needed material that is not provided as standard equipment, and it is his responsibility to ensure that such materials, as well as the installation methods he uses, result in a job that is workmanlike and in compliance with all applicable codes.  

Roberts-Gordon Factory Representatives have had training and experience in the application of this equipment and can be called on for suggestions about installation, which can save material and money.  

---

## ► Section 3. Planning

# SECTION 3: PLANNING—CODES

## Electrical
The heater must be electrically grounded in accordance with the following codes:  

- **United States:** Refer to National Electrical Code, ANSI/NFPA-70 - latest revision. Wiring must conform to the most current National Electrical Code, local ordinances, and any special diagrams furnished.  
- **Canada:** Refer to Canadian Electrical Code, CSA C22.1 Part 1 - latest revision.  

## Venting
The venting must be installed in accordance with the following codes:  

- **United States:** Refer to NFPA-54/ANSI-7223.1 - latest revision, National Fuel Gas Code.  
- **Canada:** Refer to Can 1-B149.1 and B149.2: Installation Codes for Gas Burning Appliances.  

Partial information with regard to these codes is provided in Section 8 of this installation manual with regard to size and configurations for venting arrangements.  

Any portion of vent pipe passing through a combustible wall must be dual insulated and have an approved thimble to conform with the above-listed codes.  

## Hazardous Locations
Where there is the possibility of exposure to combustible airborne material or vapor, consult the local Fire Marshall, the fire insurance carrier, or other authorities for approval of the proposed installation.  

## Critical Considerations
The Vantage II is a suspended heater. Therefore, its stability, flexibility, and safety are very important. Before starting installation, be sure the system can meet the following requirements:  

- Maintain specified clearances to combustibles, and safe distance from heat-sensitive material, equipment, and work stations.  
- Provide a suspension with a vertical length of chain or swinging rod which has at least two inches of horizontal travel for each burner in a straight run. Be sure the suspension system is sufficiently flexible to accommodate thermal expansion which occurs as the system heats up (see Figure 16).  
- Provide access to burners for servicing, preferably on both sides, above, and behind for burner removal.  
- Provide for a minimum of 18" (45 cm) of clearance between burners and building walls. The addition of side reflectors will reduce the minimum to 9". Always observe minimum clearances to combustibles.  
- Be sure the heater has a downward pitch of 1/2" per 20' (1 cm per 5 m) away from the burner.  
- Provide signs in storage areas to specify maximum stacking height to maintain required clearances to combustibles.  
- Plan the location of supports. Locate a support near all elbows.  

## Installation Procedure
Take maximum advantage of the building upper structure, beams, joists, purlins, etc., from which to suspend the heater. There is no unique sequence for installation of the tubing. On-site observation will usually reveal a logical sequence. Begin the installation at the most critical dimension. This could save time. Watch for swinging doors, overhead cranes, car lifts, etc. Reflectors and tubing can be installed as you move along. Carefully adjust system pitch at each position to level the heater. Pitch down ¼" per 20' (1 cm per 5 m) away from the burner.  

### Don't:
- Pressure test the gas line using high pressure (greater than ½ PSIG) without closing the high-pressure shut-off cocks. Failure to do so will result in damage to the burners.  

### Do:
- Familiarize yourself with local and national codes.  
- Develop a planned procedure which will conserve material and labor on the job.  
- Check to see that all material and equipment is on the job before starting installation.  
- Allow for thermal expansion of the hot tube.  
- Install the gas connector only as shown in instructions. (See Figure 24).  
- Have slip joints where required between reflectors to keep them from buckling or coming apart.  
- Provide one square inch of free air opening to each 1,000 BTU/hr of heater input but not less than 100 square inches in enclosed spaces. (6.5 cm² per 250 kcal/hr). One opening should be within 12 inches (30 cm) of the top and one within 12 inches (30 cm) of the bottom of the enclosure.

## ⚠ WARNING: Fire or Explosion Hazard ⚠  

In all situations, clearances to combustibles must be maintained. Failure to observe clearances to combustibles may result in death, severe injury, or property damage. Signs should be posted in storage areas to specify maximum stacking height to maintain required clearances to combustibles. Minimum clearances must be maintained from vehicles parked below the heater.  

Caution should be used when running the system near combustible materials such as wood, paper, rubber, etc. Consideration should be given to partitions, storage racks, hoists, building construction, etc. Figure 1 above gives minimum acceptable clearances to combustibles.

# VANTAGE INSTALLATION MANUAL  
**ROBERTS-GORDON**  

## Section 5. Standard Parts List  

The following section provides information about assembling Vantage II heaters. The heaters must be assembled according to the following illustrations and tables in order to ensure safe and proper operation.  

Vantage II burner cartons contain the basic burner unit, a Pipe Nipple and Flex Gas Line for gas connection. Turbulators (when required) are listed in Table 1.  

The remaining heater components are shipped in one of two ways:  

1) Typically, tubes, reflectors, hangers, etc. are pre-packaged at the factory. Components for heaters of up to 40 ft. (12 m) length are accommodated in one carton that includes a 10 ft. (3 m) transition tube. Longer heaters require two accessory cartons. One carton will include a transition tube. (A few minor components such as end caps may be duplicated.) Necessary packages for the various heaters are shown in Table 1 below. Components should be assembled as per Figures 2 through 18.  

2) In some cases, Vantage II heaters may be received with the accessory components non-cartoned, or packaged for a specific installation. In those cases, be sure to acquaint yourself with the individual components shown in Figure 2. Also follow carefully the appropriate diagram (Figures 3 through 7) for the heater you ordered. These indicate the quantity and location of all necessary components.  

Figures 8 through 18 show specific assembly details. Refer to Section 8 for venting assembly, Section 9 for gas piping assembly, and Section 10 for field wiring.

## Section 7. Component Installation  

### TUBE COUPLING INSTALLATION  
Tube and tube fittings are connected by wrap-around couplings which clamp by means of a tapered, hammer-driven lock member.  

#### Coupling Assembly  
To assemble the coupling:  
1. Hook the free end of the coupling sleeve into the lanced clip.  
2. Place the wide end of the tapered slide bar on the coupling so that it moves toward the lanced clip.  
3. Insert the two tube ends into the coupling. Ensure the tube ends are in line and flush against the stop pins inside the coupling.  
4. Hammer-drive the slide bar until the coupling is secured snugly to the tubes.  

> **Note:** Overdriving the slide bar will distort the coupling or slide bar lip and will decrease the holding capability of the coupling. The coupling should be tight when the slide bar is ±2" (5 cm) from the end of the coupling.

1. **Flatten reflector edge** where the joint piece matches. Put a mark on the reflector, directly over the tube center. Center the accessory joint piece on the mark and scribe its contour on the reflector. Scribe the location of the mounting holes.  
2. **Cut away the reflector** to clear the tube, leaving about one inch of material inside the scribed contour to attach the accessory joint. With an awl or other pointed tool, punch six 3/32" (2 mm) diameter holes in the reflector in the positions shown in Figure 12.  
3. **Use six #10 sheet metal screws** to attach the joint piece. Install a reflector end cap on the open end.

## REFLECTOR END CAP INSTALLATION  

Reflector end caps must be installed over the open ends of reflectors. Attach the end cap to the reflector using a minimum of four U-clips per end cap.  

Before installing the end cap, the center section must be removed. Carefully break the tabs on the bottom flange of the end cap first. Then gently flex the center section until it releases. **Be very careful not to distort or otherwise damage the end cap during this procedure.**  

If the end cap is used at a joint piece to cover a 90° elbow or U-tube, the center section should not be removed.

## TURBULATOR INSTALLATION  

For ease of installation, the turbulator should be installed in the tube before hanging the system.  
Use the following procedure (see Figure 15):  

1. Assemble turbulator pieces by **"twisting"** matching ends together.  
2. Insert a long wire (11 ft. minimum) down the length of the tube. Attach the wire to the hole in the tab on the adapter piece.  
3. Using the wire, pull the assembled turbulator into the tube from the opposite end. Pull the turbulator through until just the tab comes out. Detach the wire.  
4. Bend the tab around the tube. When installed, the vent adapter will lock the tab in place.

## SIDE EXTENSION REFLECTOR  

Optional Side Extension Reflectors may be installed on either side of the unit. Each 8 ft. section of Side Reflector should match a reflector and have identical overlap to adjacent reflectors. Provide slip joints in the same locations as the reflectors. Proceed as follows (see Fig. 16):  

1. Attach a reflector side extension support bracket to the tubes where needed. These brackets should be located adjacent to the overlapped joints of the reflectors.  
2. Insert lower edge of reflector side extension in extension support bracket.  
3. Cut suitable relief notches where the side extension reflector meets tube and reflector hangers and reflector support brackets.  
4. Hook the top edge of the side extension reflector over the edge of the reflector.  
5. A slip joint must be provided in the perimeter side extension at the location of each slip joint in the reflector. The overlap should be the same as the reflector.  
6. Where severe air movement may be encountered, as at a large door, one or two sheet metal screws should be used to attach the side extension reflectors together. Additional reflector supports are also recommended.  
7. **To Install the Retainer Clips:** Lay bracket over the side extension reflector and standard reflector at the selected location. By using the hole in the clip as a template, drill or punch a 3/32" (2 mm) diameter pilot hole in the standard reflector. Secure the retainer clip using #8 x 3/8" sheet metal screws.

## U-TUBE PACKAGE  

Vantage II heaters (except CTH2-40) are approved for optional U-Tube configurations. The U-Tube Package (P/N 03011000) includes:  
- (1) 180° U-Tube  
- (1) Plain Coupling  
- (1) Tube and Reflector Hanger  
- (2) End Caps  
- (1) U-Tube Support Bracket  
- (2) 4" (10 cm) U-Bolts with Lockwashers and Hex Nuts  

Shown below is an example CTH2-100 U-Tube configuration. One of the 10 ft. (3 m) tubes was cut in half to balance the sides. (The layout does not need to be symmetrical.) One (1) additional coupling was needed to complete the installation. The U-Tube may be installed in either a standard horizontal position or in an opposite 45° position as shown below.  

When designing a U-Tube configuration, the following rules must be adhered to:  

1. A minimum of 10 ft. (3 m) on CTH2-60/80 and a minimum of 15 ft. (4.5 m) on CTH2-100/125/150 is required between the burner and the U-Tube.  
2. The correct turbulator must be installed in the last standard section of heater tube.  
3. The burner must never be operated in a tilted position.  
4. The heater must be properly supported at all locations.

## SECTION 7: COMPONENT INSTALLATION  

### Decorative Grille Installation  

When running the heater over a suspended ceiling, a decorative grille must be used directly below the heater. The use of regular ceiling tiles directly below the heater will create an unsafe condition.  

The decorative grille option allows the heater to be installed over suspended ceilings. The aluminum grille (P/N 91407000) comes in standard 2 ft. x 4 ft. (60 cm x 120 cm) sections and is installed in place of ceiling tile.  

The system is hung in a normal fashion with the tube suspended over the grille at a height between 1½" and 14⅜" (between 4 cm and 36.5 cm). To select the appropriate side extension reflectors, calculate the distance "A" between the radiant tube and the decorative grille. See Table 4 below.  

Shields (P/N 01365900) must be placed over ceiling frame members that pass underneath the heater. The side extension reflectors are available in standard 4 ft. (120 cm) sections and have notches in the bottom corners to accommodate the suspension system. Lay the side extension reflectors along the standard reflectors and cut suitable notches for the tube and reflector hangers where appropriate. It is generally not necessary to cut notches for the reflector support straps. Gloves should be worn when handling the aluminum grille to protect hands from sharp edges.

**ROBERTS-GORDON**  

## Section 8. Venting and Ducting  

Heater must be vented in accordance with the proper national and local codes. Partial information relating to these specifications is provided in this section with regard to size and configurations for venting arrangements.  

- **United States**: Refer to ANSI Z223.1 - latest revision.  
- **Canada**: Refer to CAN/CGA-B149.1 and B149.2.  

### Heater may be vented one of the following ways:  

| Venting Method | Page Reference |
|---------------|---------------|
| Unvented (with adequate ventilation) | pg. 20 |
| Horizontal Venting - Combustible walls | pg. 21 |
| Horizontal Venting - Noncombustible walls | pg. 21 |
| Vertical Venting without Draft Hood | pg. 22 |
| Vertical Venting with Draft Hood | pg. 22 |
| Common Vertical Venting | pg. 23 |

The method chosen will depend upon a number of factors including: building ventilation, available access points in walls and ceiling, number of burners installed, installation codes, etc. Consult layout drawing for venting method used. Some installations may require the use of an outside combustion air supply. See page 24 for details.  

---

## General Venting Requirements  

Use the following guidelines to help ensure an adequate, safe venting arrangement:  

1. **Exhaust end of heater** will accept a four-inch vent pipe using the vent adapter (P/N 90502700). Install the vent adapter with the seam on top. This will prevent condensation from leaking out of the adapter.  
2. **Vent terminal opening** must be beyond any combustible overhang.  
3. **If condensation in the vent is a problem**, the vent length should be shortened or insulated.  
4. **For outside air installations**, the outside air terminal must not be installed more than one foot above the vent terminal.  
5. **Secure all joints** with a minimum of (3) #8 x 3/8 sheet metal screws.  
6. **All vent joints should be sealed** using a suitable product such as General Electric RTV106 or Permatex Form-a-Gasket red high-temperature silicone adhesive sealant.  

---

## Vent Length Requirements  

1. **Maximum vent length allowed** is 45 ft. (13.7 m).  
2. **Maximum outside air supply duct allowed** is 45 ft. (13.7 m).  
3. **Vent length plus outside air supply length plus extension package** shall not exceed 65 ft. (19.8 m).  
4. **Under length conditions (1) through (3) above**, a total of 2 elbows are allowed for vent and outside air supply together. Subtract 15 ft. (4.6 m) per additional elbow from the maximum length allowed if more than 2 elbows are used.  

---

## Unvented Operation  

1. **Sufficient ventilation must be provided** in the amount of:  
   - **United States**: 4 cfm per 1000 BTU/hr firing rate.  
   - **Canada**: 3 cfm per 1000 BTU/hr firing rate.  
2. **Use of optional outside combustion air** is not recommended with unvented heaters due to pressure considerations.  
3. **If exhaust fans are used to supply ventilation air**, an interlock switch must be used to prevent the heater from coming on when the fans are off. This may be done using an air pressure switch.  
4. **For additional information**:  
   - **United States**: Refer to ANSI Z223.1 - latest revision (NFPA No. 54) and local codes.  
   - **Canada**: Refer to CAN/CGA-B149.1 and B149.2 Installation Codes.

**ROBERTS-GORDON**  

## HORIZONTAL INSTALLATION  

### Outside Combustion Air Supply  

**IMPORTANT:** If the building has a slight negative pressure or contaminants such as halogenated hydrocarbons are present in the air, an outside combustion air supply to the heaters is strongly recommended.  

The CTH2 heater is approved for installation with an outside air supply system. An outside air supply should not be used with the draft hood venting configuration.  

For an outside air supply, a 4" O.D. (10 cm O.D.) single wall pipe may be attached to the heater. The duct may be up to 45 ft. (13.7 m) maximum length or 2 ft. (60 cm) minimum length with no more than 2 elbows. See **Vent Length Requirements** heading on pg. 20 for more detailed guidelines.  

The air supply duct may have to be insulated to prevent condensation on the outer surface. The outside air terminal should be securely fastened to the outside wall by drilling four 1/4" (6 mm) diameter holes in the outside flange; wood screws or bolts and expansion sleeves may be used to fasten the terminal.  

For the air terminal, use **Metalbestos #31267 (RG P/N 90502300), or ACME #104**, or equivalent.  

PVC pipe, aluminum flex duct, or equivalent may be used instead of single wall pipe for the outside combustion air supply.

# ROBERTS-GORDON  
## Section 9: Gas Piping  

### ⚠ WARNING ⚠  
**FIRE OR EXPLOSION HAZARD**  
*Can cause death, severe injury or property damage.*  

There is an expansion of the radiant pipe with each firing cycle, and this will cause the burner to move with respect to the gas line. This can cause a gas leak resulting in an unsafe condition if the gas connection is not made strictly in accordance with Figure 25 of these instructions.  

Read applicable warnings in Section 1 before proceeding with gas piping installation. Improper installation may result in property damage, severe injury, or death.  

Meter and service must be large enough to handle all the burners being installed plus any other connected load. The gas line which feeds the system must be large enough to supply the required gas with a maximum pressure drop of **1/2" w.c.** When gas piping is not included in the layout drawing, the local gas supplier will usually help in planning the gas piping.  

A **1/2" gas supply connection** at each burner location must be located and oriented as shown in Figure 25. To check system pressure, put a plugged **1/8" NPT tapping** in the gas line at the connection to the burner furthest from the supply. Before connecting the burners to the supply system, verify that all high-pressure testing of the gas piping has been completed.  

**DO NOT HIGH PRESSURE TEST THE GAS PIPING WITH THE BURNERS CONNECTED.**  

Follow these instructions to ensure a professional gas supply system installation:  

- Support all gas piping with suitable pipe hanging materials.  
- Use wrought iron or wrought steel pipe and malleable iron fittings. All pipe and fittings should be new and free from defects. Carefully ream the pipe and tubing ends to remove obstructions and burrs.  
- Use LP-gas-resistant joint compound on all threads.  
- Check the pipe and tubing ends for leaks before placing heating equipment into service. When checking for gas leaks, use a soap and water solution; never use an open flame.  
- Install the flex gas connector as shown. The flex gas connector accommodates expansion of the heating system and allows for easy installation and service of the burner. A **90° pipe elbow** (not supplied) must be installed on the pipe nipple to ensure proper orientation of the flex gas connector.

## Section 11. Operation  

The Vantage II heater is equipped with a hot-surface ignition system.  

### Sequence of Operation  

1. Turn the thermostat up. When the thermostat calls for heat, the blower motor will energize.  
2. When the motor approaches nominal running RPM, the air proving switch closes and activates the ignition module.  
3. The ignition module then energizes the hot surface igniter for a timed warm-up period (approximately 45 to 60 seconds).  
4. After the warm-up period, the gas valve is energized.  
5. During the last part of the sequence, the igniter is de-energized and is converted to a flame sensing rod.  
6. If a flame is detected, the gas valve remains open. When the call for heat is satisfied, and the system control mechanism de-energizes the burner line voltage supply, the gas valves are turned off.  
7. If no flame is detected on a single-try module, the gas valve is closed, and the module will lockout until it is reset. Reset is accomplished by removing power from the module for at least 5 seconds (thermostat cycle required).  
8. If no flame is detected on a three-trial module, the gas valve is closed, and a purge period begins. After the purge, the module acts to power the igniter for a second warm-up period, and a second trial for ignition period. If flame is still not established, a third and final purge, warm-up, and trial cycle begins. After three trials, the module will lockout until reset. Reset is accomplished by removing power from the module for at least 5 seconds (thermostat cycle required).  
9. On a three-trial module, if flame is established and lost on the first or second trial, the gas valve is turned off, a purge, warm-up, and trial for ignition will occur (on a three-trial module, only three trials for ignition are allowed per thermostat cycle).  

### Maintenance  

For best performance, the following maintenance procedures should be performed before each heating season:  

1. Be sure gas and electrical supply to heater are off before performing any service or maintenance.  
2. Check condition of blower scroll and motor. Dirt and dust may be blown out with compressed air, or a vacuum cleaner may be used.  
3. Check condition of burner. Carefully remove any dust or debris from inside the burner box or burner cup.  
4. Inspect the igniter. Replace igniter if there is excessive carbon residue, erosion, breakage, or other defects.  
5. Check the inside of the firing tube with a flashlight. If carbon or scale are present, scrape out the deposits with a wire brush or rod, or metal plate attached to a wooden pole.  
6. Check to see that the burner observation window is clean and free of cracks or holes. Clean or replace as necessary.  
7. Check the flue pipe for soot or dirt. After cleaning as necessary, re-attach the flue pipe to the heater.  
8. Outside surfaces of heater reflector may be cleaned by wiping with a damp cloth.  
9. A qualified service agency should be contacted for service other than routine maintenance.  
10. Check vent terminal and fresh air inlet to see that they have not become blocked during the non-heating season. If either pipe is restricted, the air switch won't close, resulting in a no-heat situation.  

## Section 12. Troubleshooting  

**CAUTION:** Before opening the Vantage II burner doors for any type of service, be sure the gas supply has been shut off at the heater, and the electrical cord from the burner box has been unplugged.  

### Blower Motor Fails to Run  

1. Is the thermostat calling for heat? Is there 115V at the burner receptacle?  
2. Check blower side door for seal. Check door switch. Replace if necessary.  
3. Check blower for obstructions. Replace blower if necessary.  

### Igniter Does Not Glow  

1. Check igniter for damage. Replace if necessary.  
2. Check voltage and resistance at igniter. (Voltage should be 115V. Resistance should be 40-75Ω).  
3. Check for obstructions to the air inlet and outlet.  
4. Check wiring and hose connections to the air switch. Replace if necessary.

# SECTION 12: TROUBLESHOOTING

## Valve Does Not Come On

Gas pressure downstream of gas control can be measured by using a manometer and connecting to the pressure tap on control.

1. Check to see if manual valve to heater is ON.
2. Check to see if manual valve knob on heater gas control is ON.
3. Supply gas pressure can be checked at 1/8" NPT pressure tapping on heater external manual valve.
4. Check to see if gas control is opening: no manifold pressure indicates valve is closed.

   If the valve is closed, either the gas valve or the ignition module is faulty.

**WARNING:** Do not disconnect ground leads inside heater. Do not interchange grounded and ungrounded leads on transformer or ignition module.

## Burner Does Not Light

1. Check to see if gas lines were properly purged of air.
2. Check inlet and outlet gas pressure during ignition period.

   - Natural inlet pressure should be **4.6"**.
   - Natural outlet pressure should be **3.5"**.
   - LP inlet pressure should be **11.0"**.
   - LP outlet pressure should be **10.5"**.

3. Check for proper orifice and air plate.

## Burner Does Not Stay Lit

1. Check ground wire continuity.
2. Check burner internal wiring for reversed leads.
3. Check insulation on the igniter leads.
4. Replace module if necessary.
